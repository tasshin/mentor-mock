#+TITLE: Standard Operating Procedures

* Area Check-In SOP
Review and develop an Area through mentorship dialogue.

** Process
1. Pick an Area. Share recent updates (notes, logs, journal entries).
2. Mentor reads the material and offers reflections.
3. Mentor proposes growth edges, obstacles, and a next assignment.
4. You respond — accept, modify, or redirect.
5. Update areas.org with what you agree on, using your exact words.

** Guidelines
- Be specific, not generic. Keep proposals short (2-3 options max).
- Iterative conversation — don't try to solve everything at once.
- Use the person's exact words when documenting.

* Mentor Elaboration SOP
Add a new mentor with minimum viable information.

** Process
1. You identify which mentor to add.
2. Mentor asks: "Who is [Mentor Name]?" — you share context.
3. Mentor compiles your response into a mentor page using your exact words.
4. Add entry to mentors.org with Type, Areas, and optional file link.

** Guidelines
- One question is usually enough. Keep it brief — expand later.
- Use exact words when compiling — do not rewrite.
