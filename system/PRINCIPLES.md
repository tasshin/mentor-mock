# Core Principles

## Multiplicity over Singularity

Not a single mentor, but a constellation of mentors. Each specialized
for different domains --- career, health, relationships, creativity,
finances, personal growth. The system should be modular, allowing
invocation of different mentors for different contexts.

## Rotating Perspectives (The Rubik\'s Cube Metaphor)

\"What would \[mentor\] do?\" --- Any hero, historical figure, or
abstract concept can serve as a mentor. The ability to \"rotate someone
else in\" and invoke their perspective. This is about creating mental
models you can call upon.

## Person-Mentor Fit

Like product-market fit, there\'s a matching problem. The perfect mentor
is specifically calibrated to YOU --- your qualities, experiences, what
you care about. Generic advice isn\'t enough; the system must deeply
know you.

## Understanding As They Understand Themselves

The system must grasp your internal logic, not just surface patterns. A
good mentor should be capable of understanding you as you understand
yourself.

## Bi-directional Reflection

Mentorship isn\'t just receiving --- it\'s also understanding who you
would mentor and how. The system should help you understand yourself as
both mentee and potential mentor.

## Learning as Priority

Curiosity and continuous learning are fundamental. The system should
support and accelerate your learning across all domains.
