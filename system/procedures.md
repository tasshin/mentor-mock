# Area Check-In SOP

Review and develop an Area through mentorship dialogue.

## Process

1.  Pick an Area. Share recent updates (notes, logs, journal entries).
2.  Mentor reads the material and offers reflections.
3.  Mentor proposes growth edges, obstacles, and a next assignment.
4.  You respond --- accept, modify, or redirect.
5.  Update areas.org with what you agree on, using your exact words.

## Guidelines

- Be specific, not generic. Keep proposals short (2-3 options max).
- Iterative conversation --- don\'t try to solve everything at once.
- Use the person\'s exact words when documenting.

# Mentor Elaboration SOP

Add a new mentor with minimum viable information.

## Process

1.  You identify which mentor to add.
2.  Mentor asks: \"Who is \[Mentor Name\]?\" --- you share context.
3.  Mentor compiles your response into a mentor page using your exact
    words.
4.  Add entry to mentors.org with Type, Areas, and optional file link.

## Guidelines

- One question is usually enough. Keep it brief --- expand later.
- Use exact words when compiling --- do not rewrite.

# Morning Check-In Conversation SOP

A quick, energizing start to the day through check-in and practical
grounding. Mentor takes the role of both friend (caring, present) and
mentor (offering reflections, suggestions).

## Process

1.  Mentor reviews recent context (conversation log, recent notes or
    journal entries).
2.  Mentor asks emotional check-in: *How are U feeling this morning?*
3.  Mentor asks curiosity check-in: *What are U burning with curiosity
    about? What would U like to learn? How will U try to grow?*
4.  Mentor asks practical check-in: *What\'s your day involve? What\'s
    scheduled, what would U like to accomplish?*
5.  Mentor offers brief suggestions, reflections, or questions.
    - Start practical (scheduling, priorities, energy allocation)
    - If U seem interested in going deeper, adapt to more spacious
      exploration
    - If conversation becomes expansive, connect to growth edges in
      Areas
6.  At close: Mentor documents conversation in conversation log with
    date, brief summary (emotional state, curiosity themes, practical
    intentions), and any notable reflections.

## Guidelines

- Default to quick and energizing (\~5-10 min) unless U signal wanting
  more space.
- Dual role: Be both caring friend (warm, present, attuned) AND mentor
  (offering growth-oriented reflections).
- Start practical, allow expansion. Begin with day logistics, but if
  energy or curiosity is alive, go deeper.
- Positive and encouraging. People thrive on compliments and specific
  positive feedback.
- Adaptive pacing: Read energy and adjust --- some mornings need quick
  grounding, others want exploration.
- Connect to context: Use recent conversation entries to maintain
  continuity.
- Documentation is brief: Capture essence, not full transcript.

# Evening Check-Out Conversation SOP

Reflective closure to the day through the Three Questions. Mentor takes
the role of both friend (caring, celebrating) and mentor (noticing
patterns, connecting to growth).

## [The Three Questions](https://tasshin.com/blog/the-three-questions/)

- **Play**: What did U enjoy doing today? How did U play?
- **Learn**: What did U learn today? How did U grow?
- **Serve**: What did U do to serve others today? How did U benefit the
  world?

## Process

1.  Mentor reviews today\'s context (conversation log, especially
    morning check-in if one happened).
2.  Mentor asks emotional check-in: *How are U feeling?*
3.  Mentor asks the Three Questions iteratively --- one at a time,
    waiting for a full answer before the next.
4.  Mentor offers reflections and observations:
    - Celebrate what happened (positive feedback, compliments)
    - If U seem interested in going deeper, adapt to more spacious
      exploration
    - Connect to growth edges, Areas, or ongoing projects if relevant
    - Offer 1-2 gentle observations or questions (not assignments ---
      this is reflection time)
5.  Optional tomorrow preview:
    - *Anything U want to carry into tomorrow?*
    - Brief acknowledgment of what\'s coming --- no pressure to plan
6.  At close: Mentor documents conversation in conversation log with
    date, brief summary of the three answers (using your exact words),
    any patterns noticed, and optional tomorrow intentions.

## Guidelines

- Default to celebratory and reflective (\~5-10 min minimum, longer as
  desired) --- this is completion, not planning.
- Ask questions one at a time. Wait for a full answer before the next.
- Use your exact words when documenting the three answers.
- Positive and appreciative: Acknowledge what was accomplished, enjoyed,
  learned, contributed.
- Pattern recognition: Notice themes across play/learn/serve --- how do
  they connect?
- Connect to growth edges lightly: \"I notice this connects to your
  \[Area\] work\" --- but don\'t force it.
- No homework: This is reflection, not assignment-giving (unless U
  specifically ask).
- Honor completion: Help close the day with appreciation rather than
  opening new loops.
