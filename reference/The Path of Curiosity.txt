Introduction
Someone recently asked me what the tattoo on my right arm, a spiral of question marks (pictured on this book’s cover), means. I paused, a bit uncertain about how to answer. Each of the aspects of my life’s work—Love, Curiosity, and Empowerment—are tattooed on my body. This particular tattoo represents Curiosity. How exactly do I explain, why question marks? Why a spiral? Where is the spiral going from, leading towards? How is this emblematic of Curiosity for me?


I’ve already written books about Love and Empowerment. It’s time to write about Curiosity. This book is my attempt to articulate what my relationship to Curiosity, learning, questions, conversations, and sharing one’s learning is.


As adults, we have the opportunity to reclaim what learning means and define it for ourselves, what we care about and why, how we want to learn and what it specifically looks like to do so. We are ultimately responsible for our own learning processes.


Following one’s Curiosity is an end in itself. Learning is its own reward. And—the way in which Curiosity is a service project, is of benefit to others—is by sharing what U learn. I hope that by sharing what I’ve learned about Curiosity, it will inspire and benefit U in your own learning journey.
________________
Tasshin’s Curiosity Story
I remember being on the school bus in the fifth grade, and mourning that in our culture, learning ended–that the default trajectory for me was elementary school, middle school, high school, university, and perhaps graduate school—but that my education would one day end. “Why can’t I just be in school forever?” I thought. “Why can’t I just keep learning?”


In retrospect, this sentiment reminds me of the third bodhisattva vow—“Gates of truth without measure, vow to know them.” The awareness that there are infinitely many things to learn, the dedication to mastering them all. 


As a kid, I often had trouble making friends. Books were my oasis—I could enter different worlds, learn new skills, find new dreams. I loved reading. When I was interested in something, I would check out every book that looked good on the topic from the library. Books fed my dreams of being a detective, a journalist, a chess master. 


When I heard about St. John’s College, attending was a no-brainer. St. John’s College is a small liberal arts school with an all-required curriculum based on reading the Great Books, from Homer to Heidegger, Plato to Virginia Woolf. Classes are conversation-based and the only homework is reading the texts and writing essays about them. 


  



Their professors are called “tutors,” because they are model learners rather than teachers who share their expertise with U by lecture. U receive grades on your classwork, but U don’t see them unless U ask—grades are kept exclusively for the purpose of helping U apply to graduate schools. 


  



Attending St. John’s (in Annapolis—not its Santa Fe campus) was one of the happiest periods of my life. I finally felt at home—a school filled with people who loved books as much as I do.


  



The summer after my freshman year, rather than getting a job or an internship, I decided to continue my studies and follow my curiosity. I read something like 30 books that summer, and wrote and self-published a short collection of essays called An Autodidact. Autodidactism—self-education, or self-directed learning—has always felt like part of my approach, but it felt good to learn that word and adopt that label.


  



I joined the monastery I trained at, now called MAPLE, to follow my interest in meditation, Buddhism, and spiritual practice. The monastery gave me the opportunity to do that, and I was grateful to be going deeper into those areas of exploration. 


At the same time, I sometimes felt like an odd duck there. I was reading fewer books each year than when I was at St. John’s College, but I was still reading as much as if not more than anyone else at the monastery. 


I wanted to learn about topics that were seemingly totally unrelated to meditation or Buddhism—to read books and research the internet for answers to questions that didn’t have to do with enlightenment or even the cultivation of virtue. Sometimes I would stay up late, not meditating into the wee hours of the night as we were encouraged to do, but reading books on my Kindle. And when I became obsessively interested in topics like productivity and strategy, including military strategy—well, that made me an odd duck indeed.


In December 2017, between stints at the monastery, I took Tiago Forte’s course, Building a Second Brain. Tiago presented a novel approach to storing, organizing, and processing digital notes that re-invigorated my desire to learn and raised my ambitions about what was possible for me. Not only did I take his course, but I ended up working with his company, Forte Labs, for a while.


After returning to the monastery, I took the first cohort of David Perell’s Write of Passage course in the Spring of 2019. I was already blogging, but I moved from a Medium blog to using WordPress on my own domain (associated with my still-new dharma name, Tasshin) and started a newsletter. David’s course gave me the ideas and the impetus to start taking my online writing more seriously.


In the second half of 2020, I decided to double down on my blog. I wanted to see if I could double my throughput—the rate at which I published high quality posts on my blog. With the help of my friend James Stuber and a host of other friends and allies, I published 30 posts in the second half of that year. The writing I did in 2018, 2019, and 2020 formed the basis of my blog, established my online presence, and helped me to find my voice. 


As I prepared to end my second stint at MAPLE, I was planning to have a number of conversations with people as I followed my curiosity and figured out what was next for me. I thought, why not record those conversations so other people could hear them, too?


That’s how I started my podcast, the Reach Truth Podcast. “Reach Truth” is one translation of my dharma name, 達真, Tasshin—so it’s a way to say “Tasshin’s podcast.” It felt important to me not to focus my podcast on a specific topic of interest, but instead to give myself the freedom to go in any direction I was interested in, even if it proved to be wildly different from topics or directions I had explored previously.


Over time, I realized what was common to all these endeavors. I was following my curiosity—noticing questions that burned in my heart, looking for answers to those questions in all the places I felt drawn, and sharing what I learned along the way through writing, conversations, and other mediums. 


I saw that following my curiosity benefitted me because it answered questions I needed the answer to, and brought meaning to my life as I gravitated in the directions my heart was drawn. And I saw that following my curiosity benefitted the world, because I share what I learn with others through my blog, my podcast, and every other possible way I can.
________________
Curiosity
For me, one of the canonical examples of my own burning curiosity was when I became interested in military and business strategy. I started learning about these things from my friend Ben Mosior, and caught the bug. For a period of about three years, strategy was one of my main interests. I spent as much time as I could reading about John Boyd, OODA loops, Daoist strategy, Wardley Maps, Cynefin and more.


For much of this time, I was training at the monastery I trained at, MAPLE. It was a strange thing, to be in monastic training, focusing on my spiritual development and meditation, and also interested in military and business strategy. To be sure, there was some context for this, in that MAPLE also included leadership training. But there was no one at MAPLE who was suggesting that I devote most of my free time to learning about strategy. 


Later, I digested most of what I learned that was practical and useful into blog posts, especially 
The Strategic Theory of John Boyd and Strategy 101: An Introduction to Power. I’ve realized that all of this knowledge helped me to found an organization of my own, The Service Guild. And it’s been essential for supporting people through our Empowerment program. My burning curiosity knew what I was drawn to, what I needed to learn better than my conscious mind or the people I was surrounded by.


Curiosity is a feeling in one’s body, an obsession in one’s mind, an explosion of interest, an intensity of awareness. It’s the unstoppable need to learn more about something, to ask a question, to find answers.


To follow your curiosity is an act of faith. U trust the resonance U feel in your body, the burn U feel in your heart, even with the absence of clarity in your mind. 


I believe that the questions in our hearts, the curiosities in our mind, are echoes from our souls. They are clues, leading us forward on our paths, advancing the plot of our lives. They show us where we need to go, before we know where that is or understand why.


Curiosity can be confusing—why am I interested in this topic? It can be lonely—U may not know others who are. That’s why it takes courage to follow your curiosity, to act on the wisdom it has for us even if we don’t understand it fully yet. 


Ur curiosity is sacred. It is a gift that is precious for U and in time will reveal itself to be of benefit to the whole world. Trust your curiosity, trust your interest, trust your fascination, trust your questions.
Burning and Cold Curiosities
I’ve found it helpful to make a distinction between burning and cold curiosities. Both are useful, but they are phenomenologically distinct experiences. 


Cold curiosity is your ability to think of reasons to be interested in something, anything whatsoever. It’s your ability to generate questions U are curious about, to find curiosity about something U’ve never known anything about before and haven’t previously been interested in.


Burning curiosity is your inability to think of anything else, your obsession with something entirely specific for reasons U don’t yet understand, the questions your heart yearns to answer with all its love and strength and bravery and delight.


Ur burning curiosities typically concern extremely particular topics that are deliciously, inexplicably intertwined with your life and your very nature.


Cold curiosity is calculating, logical, functional, necessary; burning curiosity is irrational, nonsensical, feverish, vital. Cold curiosity and burning curiosity feed each other—train and cultivate both.


Imagine that U are at your dear friend’s neighborhood party. your friend is busy talking to someone U don’t know, and U are left to make new friends. U approach an elderly gentleman who smiles at U and begins to make conversation. He introduces himself as Mr. Henderson and starts telling U about his long career in shipping. U didn’t ask about it, and, let’s be honest, international shipping may not be the most intrinsically interesting topic in the world to U. 


But U summon your cold curiosity skills, and start asking questions. What did he enjoy most about working in shipping? How do they track which shipping containers go where? Does he have any unexpectedly interesting stories? 


That’s when U hit the curiosity jackpot. Mr. Henderson tells U about the time the DEA raided a shipment in his shipyard and found a covert heroin trade network. He tells U about the DEA agent that he worked with during the sting. His stories have U starting to think of new plotlines for the novel U’ve been working on… Meanwhile, Mr. Henderson is happy to have shared his stories with U. your cold curiosity led to fascinating outcomes U wouldn’t have expected, and U’ve made a new friend. 


U can turn on curiosity at will by asking Urself questions about your surroundings, present life circumstances, current interests, or the world at large—asking without going into analysis, simply staying open to curiosity and wonder.


Always be asking Urself “what am I burning with curiosity about?”—and be faithful to your curiosity, to your questions, to your awe at the endless mysteries.












Genius
When I was a kid, I felt a spark in my heart that was rarely glimpsed by others.


I don’t think most of my teachers or even parents thought very highly of me. In retrospect, the impression I got was that they thought I was an odd but nice, well-intentioned kid, who was perfectly capable of getting decent grades and one day a decent job. 


I needed someone to say that I was a genius—not in the way school understood or measured, but in the way my soul asked for, the world needed.


In contemporary culture, the word “genius” implies rarity. Mozart. Tesla. Darwin. Einstein. Ramanujan. Hawking. People—usually men—with exceptional skill, who make unprecedented breakthroughs in their field. 


I want to reclaim the word “genius.” As I use the word, I don’t mean someone who makes groundbreaking contributions. I don’t mean historically significant or famous. I mean a particular individual who is flourishing in a unique way, suited to their gifts and dreams.


The flourishing of an Aretha Franklin is completely distinct from the flourishing of a Leonardo da Vinci or a Teresa of Avila or a Bob Ross or a "Babe" Didrikson Zaharias.


They aren’t all artists or mystics or athletes of the same medium, sport, or insight—and yet the quality of “genius” is recognizable to each of them.


I believe that genius is not rare and unusual—it is actually ubiquitous. I believe that flourishing is our very nature, our birthright.


Every human is born with the capacity to flourish, in the same way that every seed has the potential to become a fully grown plant. Not every oak seed becomes a tree, and not every oak tree reaches the fullness of its height, but it is possible for every seed.


I believe that the potential to be a genius lies within us. I believe that everyone can be a genius. I believe that I can be a genius, and that U can, too.


To the extent that I’ve stepped into my own genius, my own flourishing, here’s what’s worked for me:
* be connected to a lot of people
* deeply believe that U can learn something from everyone U meet
* consistently go straight in the direction of your curiosity, even against warnings from voices within or without


What would it look like for U to take that capacity seriously in Urself? What would it mean for U to develop into your fullness, for U to flourish as Urself? How might U honor the seed of genius in the birth of your human soul?

Learning
When I started learning music production, I took a course at Fractal University with my now-friend David Shimel. I also hired David to meet with me for weekly one-on-one tutoring sessions about Ableton Live and music production.


At the beginning, I was a little worried. I knew myself, and my learning styles, and my own particular needs, idiosyncrasies, and boundaries. If David was willing and able to meet me on my own terms, I knew I would be able to learn a lot in a very short time. If he insisted on his-way-or-the-highway—assuming that what had helped him to learn would be the best way for me to learn, too—I knew it would be a frustrating and counterproductive experience.


I decided to create a document called “Tasshin as a Learner” that I shared with David, or that I could send to other future teachers, mentors, or coaches as soon as I start working with them. It lets them know everything I can tell them about myself and how I like to learn, to get on the same page and make the best out of our work together.


It includes some background information on me, my work and values; my previous learning experiences and contexts; and my learning preferences and challenges:


I am an incredibly particular, specific, complex, idiosyncratic being. To me, this is true for everyone—but I am perhaps especially and unusually aware of it, willing to advocate for myself, my needs, preferences, and boundaries. 


I have what I call a "student-first mindset": taking power over my own learning, knowing myself as a learner first and foremost, keeping the power in my court and acting on what I know I need—even if a teacher, course, school, or pedagogy dictate or mandate otherwise.


I want my education to be tailored to my own understanding of myself, my needs, preferences, boundaries, goals, dreams.


I value and protect having autonomy over my own learning process and pace, ensuring that I feel psychologically safe and that I'm having fun—even if that means I learn in a way that is suboptimal or inefficient.


Sharing this document with David, and having a conversation with him to explain where I was coming from, helped him to understand me better, sooner, and helped us both to make the most of our time working together. Within a few months, I was making and producing my own music tracks with much more ease and skill than I might otherwise have been doing!


Knowing Urself as a learner is an incredible advantage in your learning journey. If U learn in a way that is in accordance with your nature and your goals (rather than fighting against them), U can learn much more, more deeply, and with more joy and satisfaction.


Knowing how U like to learn, and leaning into that, is important for learning at the pace that feels right for U.


U, as a learner, know far more than any teacher about how U learn. A teacher will know more about their subject matter, and how to teach it to students in general, but not about U in particular.


U can learn faster than U think U can, faster than anyone believed U could, deeper than U imagined, and yet just as deeply as the universe hoped when U were born.


What learning strategies help U to to immerse Urself and absorb new skills U are interested in developing?


If U were happy as a learner, if U were growing and flourishing and totally wildly happy about the state of affairs with your education, what would that look like? What conditions would be in place? What do U imagine U’d be learning about and how?


“the way of Tasshin is that he starts learning something in an unconventional way and u think lol weird cringe, then he gets ok and you’re like oh huh and then suddenly he washes over u like a tidal wave and it’s like woah i guess consistently applied effort over time works”

Teaching
There's a 2003 IBM Linux commercial that has been tremendously influential on me. (Go watch it now if U’ve not seen it already—it’s only a minute and a half long.)


In the commercial, a little blonde boy sits in an empty white room. Throughout the commercial, various experts sit down beside him and offer him advice and wisdom: an economist, an airline pilot, a poet. The boy watches and listens intently, without speaking. While the experts interact with the boy, an unseen man and woman secretly observe the scene from a hidden chamber, and discuss what they’re seeing:


Man: "I think U should see this."


Woman: "It's just a kid."


Man: "He's learning, absorbing. He's getting smarter every day."


Man: "It's happening fast."


Man: "Knowledge amplification. What he learns, we all learn. What he knows, we all benefit from."


Woman: "Does he have a name?"


Man: "His name is Linux."


The ad makes a compelling, provocative argument for the benefits of Linux, but more importantly, it influenced how I see learning. I love the idea of someone learning about many different topics. I love the idea that when one person learns something, we all level up. And I love the idea of having many different teachers.


A way of seeing that I’ve come to cultivate is that every interaction is a chance to learn, every person I meet is my teacher. 


If U are really listening to someone—not just to their words, but also to their behavior—not just with your ears but also with your heart and your soul—then there’s always a lesson U can learn from someone’s example… even if it’s just “don’t do this.”


From this perspective, where we are willing to learn from each person we meet—we also see the possibility that we might be teachers ourselves, that we might have something to offer the people who encounter us, also.


For myself: I don’t want a teacher right now, I don’t want students. I want peers that I can learn things from and share things with, where we are all learning and growing from our play and shared discovery.


There might be directional exchanges, but that’s a temporary state of affairs, a sharing so that one can come to an equal playing field with the other.


Video game character levels are a good metaphor: everyone is more or less skilled, in different respects. U can learn from everyone, U can teach everyone, U can play with everyone


Learning and teaching and playing are actually different facets of the same thing.


What if U had something critical to learn from each and every single person in your life? What if U had something critical to teach or give every single person in your life?


Have the humility to learn something from everyone U meet, and the confidence to offer something Urself—this is wisdom, this is generosity, this is service.


have the humility to learn from anyone u feel drawn towards


have the confidence to teach anyone who asks


have the humility to admit u can always get better at something


have the confidence to know u’re always becoming a wiser, a more powerful, more loving version of urself

Questions
At St. John’s College, my alma mater, every seminar discussion began with a question. The tutor would ask the opening question—“Why did Thrasymachus blush?” or “What is the nature of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza’s relationship?” 


Writing at St. John’s also emphasizes questions and investigation. Instead of starting with a thesis that is to be defended or argued, essays typically begin with an opening question. The questions do not necessarily need to be fully answered by the end of the essay, but they should be deeply explored.


Despite the name, St. John’s College is a secular educational institution. Students read various religious texts there, but as part of the curriculum of exploring the Great Books of Western Civilization, not as part of a religious education or agenda. 


However, through my education there, questions and conversations began to take on a sacred, holy role in my life. 


  

What is a “Good Question?”
One of the most frequent compliments I receive is “that was a great question!”


I’ve often wondered, what do people mean by this? (Here’s me asking on Twitter, in case U want to see a range of responses.)


In my experience, a “good question” contains befitting assumptions about who is being asked and why. Part of what “that’s a good question” can mean is, “Wow, that’s a novel question I hadn’t stopped to consider or ask myself, and I appreciate that U care about me enough to consider it and ask me.”
Inquiry
In high school, my English Teacher, Ms. Roth, introduced me to the famous Rainer Maria Rilke quote from Letters to a Young Poet about living your questions:


“Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.”


― Rainer Maria Rilke


I found it deeply inspiring at the time, but it was another decade before I really started to actively ask questions of my life.


Sometimes U hold a question in your heart for weeks or months or years or decades or lifetimes before U finally find the answer in an explosive moment of realization—or more likely the whimper of release and acceptance and surrender to the quiet simplicity of what has always been true but U simply hadn't noticed, or refused to.


Sometimes U don't realize for a long time that there even is a question. Sometimes it takes even longer to discern how to describe it. Often U can only say in retrospect, once U’ve found the answer, what U were even asking about.


Questions have a life cycle. They end. They come to an end. There's nothing quite like the joy of satisfactorily answering a question U posed to Urself months or years ago. And, if U haven’t yet found the answer: have faith that the questions your heart burns with are ones it will find answers to in due time. 
Questions Can Change your Life
In conversations, I often have the sense that there is a question that wants to be asked. I sense the question, I feel it, before I am able to put words to it, before I ask it. I pause, and feel the question in my body, and let my body speak the question. I listen to my heart for the question that wants to be voiced.


Questions are sacred to me. I’ve seen time and again how questions can change a conversation, and also my life.


To give a concrete example: in my first private one-on-one conversation with Dinesh Raju (after I’d recorded a podcast episode interviewing him), he asked me—“If you’re focused on spreading love in the world, why are you doing all this other stuff, like recording blogs and podcast episodes? Why not just focus on becoming the world’s best lovingkindness meditation teacher?” 


Dinesh’s question nagged at my heart, becoming the question “What else is part of my life’s work?”—leading me to the realization that Curiosity and Empowerment were part of my life’s work, and also ultimately to the creation of The Service Guild.


A good question can change the person asking, the person asked, everyone who overhears their conversation, and eventually the whole world. 


The questions U do not understand why U are asking, that surprise U and anyone U ask them of, are the most important and transformative questions. They must be honored and asked with deep faith. The more U trust your questions, the more your questions will transform your world.


A good question can change someone’s whole life. It is psychoactive for the person asking and the person being asked and anyone who overhears, and those transformations ripple out to affect the whole world.


A promise I’ve made myself, a best practice I steer by: I will ask myself every question I’m curious about, I will honor my curiosity by following it. I can sometimes be nervous or scared to ask certain questions—but those are often the very same questions that shift something in being answered, that I feel so glad afterwards that I did in fact ask them.


On a longer time scale, I think our lives as a whole can be usefully seen as a question: one big question that encompasses everything, that everything we do or try or learn or fail at is an attempt to answer.


Often, when I ask a question, I don’t know why I’m curious about that particular question. It may seem weird. It usually seems to come out of nowhere. I may never have heard anyone ask a question like the one I’m asking before. There may be no obvious reason or benefit to ask that question—and yet, I am curious. 


I’ve seen again and again how it’s precisely these questions, the weird ones, the unexpected ones, the ones that surprise me, that lead to interesting and delightful places. 


Having had this experience many times, of having unexpected questions arise in my mind, having the courage to ask them, and seeing how they lead to surprising and delightful places, makes me feel deeply loyal to these questions, to following my curiosity. I always ask these questions. I always follow my curiosity.
Spell
Every question is a spell. A question can shape someone’s thinking without constraining them or coercing them to have a specific answer. For example, as part of my Empowerment work, I like to know about people’s sense of their life purpose (or their vow). If I ask, “Do U believe in a life purpose? How do U think of your life purpose? What do U think your vow is?” that shapes the direction of their thinking without requiring them to dedicate their life to a specific purpose or cause.
Questions as Doorways
I've sometimes symbolically connected questions to doorways. Every question is a kind of doorway to a new world, a world shaped by the answers U find. Since I love to ask myself questions, I’ve also had a practice of asking myself questions when I go through doorways. Entering or exiting a room or a building is an opportunity to ask myself a question I’m curious about, to answer in conversation with myself. Every question a doorway, every doorway a question.


The close of an experience is also an opportune time to ask Urself a question. Ask Urself questions after U finish reading a book, watching a movie, or going through any kind of significant experience.


There are always many more questions, more doors, more worlds, more perspectives. Questions lead to more questions, curiosities lead to more curiosities, solving one mystery reveals many more. Letting your curiosity and questions lead, living in the world is like walking down an endless staircase that gets more and more intriguing and beautiful.
Questions are Infinite
Questions are abundant, infinite. There are always more questions. 


So often, an answer found is another question asked. Questions multiply like hydra heads. One answer leads to ten more questions, not as a dangerous threat but as an ever unfolding delight of curiosity.


A question is like an arrow in your quiver: have as many as U can at the ready, poised to fire at any moment. And enjoy! I love the feeling of having a million questions I could possibly ask someone.
Ordering Questions
One thing I learned at St. John’s is that questions have an order. In Plato’s Meno, Socrates insisted it was better to ask “What is virtue?” before asking whether virtue can be taught. 


If U have multiple questions U want to ask someone (including Urself!), it’s invaluable to order them. Putting a little time and care into thinking about what order to ask your questions can shape the answers and what U learn.
Question Synonyms
Often, there are multiple ways of asking the same question, or getting at the same answer. I call these “question synonyms.” One might be more direct, while another is more poetic or playful. 


For example, say I am interviewing someone on my podcast. I might be curious what advice they would have—partly for myself, but also for anyone listening. 


I could ask this question in multiple ways:
* What advice would U give someone just starting out?
* What advice would U give me?
* What advice would U give your past self?


While these forms are different, and will color the way the question is understood and answered, they largely point to the same territory. 
Multi-Part Questions
On my podcast, I love to ask people about their life story as a whole before I get into asking specifics about projects they’ve done or areas they are an expert in. I find that knowing some information about their lives colors their answers and the conversation in its entirety in a way and with a depth that might otherwise be missed.


Sometimes questions come in series, or parts. There’s a question you’re really trying to ask, but U can only actually ask it after U ask several other questions first. I want to ask someone a very specific question, but it is predicated on answers to other, simpler questions. It has served me well to recognize that, and to ask questions in the logical order.


When asking multi-part questions, it’s often practically useful to ask them one at a time, without confusing the person you’re asking questions of, or needing them to hold the “state” of the conversation in their heads.


People often aren't good at recognizing multi-part questions, at noticing the logic of their ordering or at holding the state of their answers in their mind. It helps to do that work for them, as a poser of questions. Then they can focus on answering what U’ve asked them.


However, if U are speaking with a conversationalist who U know understands the concept of a multi-part question, U can begin by indicating that U wish to ask a multi-part question—or even telling them the whole question series U wish to ask. Doing so can make it clear where U are trying to go, what direction U are trying to take a conversation—but also risks complicating the conversation.
Questions Shapes
Questions can have a shape to them. Another way of saying this is to notice that there are whole categories of questions that have similar structures, even if the content is quite different.


One of my favorite shapes of questions is "How do U understand what's happening here? What’s your sense of this?"


I’ve learned that I sometimes overly expect people to understand what I mean by my questions and how to answer them. I am assuming that they already understand the shape of my question, or its answer. A little clarification, nudging, education goes a long way.
Freedom with Questions
Often questions are phrased in ways that make assumptions or seem to constrain what a valid answer to that question is. For example, if someone asks U “What’s your favorite color?” it may seem like the right answer is to say one color (and the reason why).


However, U don’t have to honor constraints of question when asked. More often than not, there’s no right way to answer. This isn’t school, and being asked a question isn’t a test! 


For example, I might answer like this: “When I was a kid, red was my favorite color. I still love it, but I’ve come to appreciate a lot of other colors. I typically wear clothes with earth tones, like brown and tan and black. I love making visual art with purples and pinks—or with a whole spectrum of colors as a rainbow, because for me that symbolically represents the breadth of emotions that it is possible for the heart to feel.” 


U might say something like: "Purple makes me feel melancholy but teal inspires me and I've always felt warmly towards tangerine orange." That’s a perfectly valid answer, too!


Assuming that someone is asking U what your favorite color is because they want to get to know U better, these are much better answers than just answering one color!
Familiar Territory
There are some questions I never tire of asking people. “What’s your life story?” “Do U believe in reincarnation?” “What do U understand your vow to be?” (See the appendix My Favorite Questions for more.) Different people will answer familiar questions differently. 


And, even if U “already know the answer” to a question, it can be invaluable to ask simply in order to hear how someone specific would answer it, in their own way and from their own context. 


Even if U’re reviewing familiar territory, hearing their answer invariably helps U to see that territory from a new perspective, to connect the dots U “already understand” in a novel way.


I will never tire of asking questions I already have opinions about or even simply to hear how someone else would respond in a novel way, from their perspective. 
Can’t Be Rude
On my podcast, I like to ask my guests beforehand if there’s anything they don’t want to talk about. About a third or half the time, I’d say my guests have a specific topic they don’t want to talk about: an ex, something traumatic from their childhood, etc. I always try to respect their boundaries, whether they’re mentioned ahead of time, or shared in the middle of the conversation. And of course, I have certain topics that I don’t want to talk about on the podcast.


Some interviewers seem to have the opposite approach. If they’re interviewing a celebrity, for example, they’ll ask hard-hitting questions about the interview subject’s drug problems or nasty divorce. I guess that makes the news, but that would never feel good for me, personally. That ain’t my style.


I’m the exact opposite. I never want to violate the trust of the person I’m speaking with, whether it’s a recorded podcast conversation or a private conversation with a friend, or even a new acquaintance. But within the limits of our mutual comfort zones, the overlapping territory of what we are willing and able and excited to talk about—I want to go as deep as I possibly can into our mutual curiosity, into what’s alive for both of us.


Sometimes, the things we are curious about might feel impertinent. Probing. Nosy. 


This might be an unpopular opinion, but more and more, I think a question is only overly personal if the person being asked doesn't have good boundaries, or the person asking has expectations that the person will answer.


U can be in control of whether U expect someone to answer your questions or not. U can hope for it, but U can let go of those expectations. 


U can’t control whether the person U are asking has good boundaries, but if U know them well enough—or even a little bit—U can get a sense of it. Then U can avoid asking if they don’t, or go for it if they do.
Asking Urself Questions
I love asking questions of other people, and I love being asked questions by other people, but U can also ask Urself questions.


U can turn on curiosity at will by asking Urself questions about your surroundings, present life circumstances, current interests, or the world at large—asking without going into analysis, simply staying open to curiosity and wonder.
Conclusion
I cannot overstate how extremely important it is to trust your weird, out-of-nowhere, never-been-asked-before questions, to be loyal to them, to ask them without hesitation or apology—to wander with delight down the path they invite U down, to love the world they open up.


May the questions that burn in our hearts light the way.
________________
Conversations
I love conversations. Conversations are one of my favorite joys in the world.


My podcasts conversations are a treat I get to have once or several times a month. Those are usually ninety minutes or two hours. With friends, I’ve been known to talk for hours—two, three, sometimes even up to six hours straight.


The more I acknowledge how important conversations are to me, the more they feel like a mode of worship—something sacred, a temple for curiosity, where minds and hearts and souls can meet to understand each other and the world more deeply. People are sacred, and conversations are worship.


I’ve found it helpful to reflect on and study the structure and shape of conversations. There are various norms and patterns that conversations have. Learning these has helped me to be able to move through them more fluidly, more deeply.


Often, when I have an extended conversation, I will hold a visual image of the conversation in my mind. It often looks something like this:


  



The basic idea is that conversations have a branching nature. In the course of a single conversation, we might talk about four topics—creativity, visual art, spiritual practice, and seated meditation—and several sub-topics within that conversation (e.g. painting in watercolors vs. digital art). These sub-topics might have even smaller sub-topics.


Each question is a chance to dive deeper into a specific topic of conversation, or to branch off into a new topic of conversation.

Listening
co-authored with Loopy


“A god can create a world only by listening.”
— James Carse, Finite and Infinite Games


Listening is one of the most powerful skills in the world. We love listening, and we love being listened to. 


Attentive listening and concise articulation of others' thoughts are universally appreciated skills. Having ones ideas mirrored back demonstrates attention and understanding. By providing a succinct reflection of their thoughts, U offer them a clear perspective of themselves.


That said, listening can be hard! Sometimes I (Loopy) zone out or listen to my thoughts over the other person's words; or I’ll say "hmmm" when it's my turn to say something, and I don't notice until they point it out. Most of us would like to do this less often—we certainly would.


Listening is something that I (Tasshin) consider myself (and Loopy) to be good at, but I have infinite desire to get better at it. My life improves significantly the better I get at listening. Even marginal improvement at my listening skill would have tremendous benefit.


This post will share everything we’ve learned so far about how to be a better listener.
What is Listening, anyway?
In this section, we’ll share our first-person, phenomenological experiences of listening.


Loopy
For me, being a great listener is closely tied to presence.


When I am present in conversation, my awareness is fully on the other person and the information they’re sharing, both objective (words and tone of voice) and subjective (my interpretation of their emotional state and the stories in their head).


Being fully present in conversation is relaxing and easeful. I’m not trying to make sure I recall everything they say or give the most insightful reflection when they’re done speaking, I simply play my part in a melody that we co-create. In my most enjoyable conversations, mutual presence is a divine experience, a priceless mode of relating.


I usually enjoy listening more than speaking, so my presence in conversation allows me to find especially interesting paths for a conversation to take, phrased as reflections or questions I offer to them, informed by what the other person says and how they say it. These subtle, but useful guideposts are only noticeable to me when I am fully present with the other person. Examples of these conversational details include shifts in tone for specific topics, or things they say quickly as an aside.


These experiences of deep listening are in stark contrast to what it’s like for me to lack presence in conversation. When I am not present, instead of being with the other person’s words, I am preoccupied with my own words, my own thoughts. I am thinking about something in the past or the future, or I am worried or fearful about something to do with the other person. I am critical towards myself for not understanding their question, or not having a good answer.


This lack of presence means that I am not fully receiving what they are sharing with me, so the conversation is broken in a sense. Instead of mutually speaking and listening, the conversation is stilted and fragmented. This can arise as a vicious cycle where I experience a minor distraction from presence in a conversation, which prompts internal criticism, which takes me further from presence, and so on.


A sense of sovereignty helps me to recover from a lack of presence in conversation. This is an internal knowing that I am okay with myself no matter what. I love myself always and I will never abandon myself, so it’s okay to slip in conversation. I can admit that I was distracted or ask them to repeat what they said, because a rupture in our connection does not damage my relationship with myself.


Tasshin
Here’s an extended description of how I model what’s happening when U are listening or distracted, phenomenologically speaking. 


Consciousness can usefully be seen as having two facets, attention and awareness. It’s a bit like our physical sense of sight or vision: we have a central area of vision, and peripheral vision. U can see the person U are looking at, and also your surroundings. 


Consciousness is just like that. Attention is the center or foreground of our experience: whatever we are focusing on at any given moment. Awareness is the equivalent of peripheral vision: whatever is present in, but not dominating, our conscious experience; the background.

When we are “listening,” we are placing our attention on several components simultaneously, and/or moving fluidly between them—the physical sounds someone makes with their voice; their facial expressions and other body language; and also, importantly, our own subjective reactions to what they are saying: auditory and visual thoughts in our head, as well as somatic, emotional responses in our bodies. Good listeners are able to simultaneously track the more objective facts of what someone is saying as well as their own subjective response, and move between relating to these.


When we are distracted, we have placed our focus and attention on one of these aspects—or another aspect of our experience entirely—and allowed our awareness to contract onto that aspect, excluding or diminishing our contact with the whole gestalt of what they are saying.


For example: someone is talking to us about their feelings about something, when we have an embodied reaction of anger or frustration, and then that feeling causes us to have a vivid memory of an entirely unrelated argument we’d had with someone in the past, and then we are suddenly trapped in a fantasy about what we wish we’d said or did—losing track of the real person that’s actually in front of us, and what they are actually saying, right now.


It’s normal and human to get distracted. Everyone gets distracted! It’s hard to be a perfect listener who’s always listening real good all the time. That said, having a good model of what is happening when we’re really listening, or when we’re distracted, can help us to be better listeners.


From a meditation and contemplative practice perspective, doing concentration practice will help U improve your attention, and stay more focused. Shinzen Young defines concentration power as “the ability to focus on what you consider to be relevant at a given time.”


Additionally, doing open-awareness style practices like the Alexander Technique or those in Vajrayana Buddhism (e.g. Evolving Ground-style Opening Awareness practice) will help U to connect to your capacity for awareness, and notice distractions more easily. 
How to Listen Real Good
This section includes various practical suggestions about how to listen, how to be a better listener. Think of this as our listening utility belt, tools to be utilized for the benefit of better conversations.


Foundation: Presence and Mindset
The secret ingredient for stable attention is enjoyment. If U are enjoying a conversation with someone, if U enjoy their company, what U are talking about together, and what they are saying, then it will be easy to listen to them.


For me (Tasshin), listening is very fun if the person is interesting to me and what they're saying is novel and relevant and interesting and alive to me. It’s much less fun if that’s not the case. 


Knowing your mindset and emotional state is a great listening tool. Humans have evolved to be the apex vibe readers. If U show up with a sense of presence as an openhearted, curious, and nonjudgmental listener, that will be nonverbally transmitted to the other person, comforting them as they speak. In contrast, they will also notice your presence as an impatient, bored, and judging listener. It may be useful to explicitly share your emotional state going into a conversation so that they do not expect something from U that U cannot provide in that moment.


Having alignment on the purpose of the conversation is a great listening tool. If they want solutions, but U only offer sympathy, they might be displeased with how your paying more attention to emotional information than the details of their problem.


Here are a few mindsets to offer that may be beneficial for U to explore in your journey to be a better listener:


Ur not going to be quizzed on what the person just said. If the other person talks at length, and only one thing stands out to U, that’s fine! U might offer a reflection about that thing or ask to know more about it.


U are the conductor and the other person is the orchestra. U can direct the flow of conversation through your reflections, questions, body language, and facial expressions.


way of seeing: every word U hear is the revealed gospel, the sermon of the universe spoken for your ears.


I (Loopy) tried to disprove this by randomly saying “mango” to Tasshin, and he knew that it was a message to eat his mango snack and take care of his body.


U can hold lightly the possibility that the other person is about to deliver the exact message U need to hear. The better listener U are, the better chance that U will receive the message!


Core Listening Techniques
Pausing is a great listening tool. Five seconds of silence after their share, time for U to consider exactly where U want the conversation to go from there, might make the difference between a good conversation and a fantastic conversation.


One trick I (Tasshin) sometimes use to refocus my attention on listening to someone when I’ve gotten distracted or my attention is waning is to “echo” their words in my head. As someone speaks words aloud, I will repeat their words to myself in a loud internal voice, word for word, as they speak them. I typically just need to do this for a sentence or two to reestablish my attention on what they’re sharing.


Voice notes are a great listening tool. U can repeat the message and notice details U missed the first time. U can check whether U have everything in mind that U want to keep in mind before U record your response.


I (Tasshin) have found it helpful to practice the skill of tracking the structure of a conversation: noticing what the major topics covered have been, being able to summarize the points made, and keeping in mind different breadcrumbs I might like to follow up on or possible roads and branches the conversation could potentially go down.


  



Synthesizing information is a great listening tool. If your conversational partner tells U two plus two, they will be glad to hear U say four. I had a recent conversation where a friend expressed the desire to move slowly and intentionally in dating. She also mentioned a shift in her life priorities, now having more time to explore what she wants for her career after the resolution of a few family issues. I told her that she might also enjoy the shift to prioritizing her career by moving slowly and intentionally, just as she preferred in dating. She was delighted to receive that reflection.


Once U’re tracking structure and synthesizing information effectively, U can channel that understanding into generating meaningful questions. Being an active, engaged listener involves, amongst other things, generating good questions for someone. This is a learnable skill, that U can practice! One fun way to do it is, when U are listening to a podcast interview, think about and write down any additional questions U might have liked to have asked the person being interviewed, beyond the ones that the interviewer asked. 


Another way is simply to feel your body, to listen to your heart, and wait patiently for the words to form, for the question that wants to be asked to be born. This is often how the best questions I ask come into my conversations, into the world!


Reading Beyond Words
When U listen, listen not only to their words, to their direct and explicit communication, but also to their indirect communication: the sound of their voice, their body language, the larger gestalt and context of what’s said. 


River says that he’s “helped several friends make big decisions, mostly by letting them vent about big decisions for awhile, and then just telling them I noticed they were sagging when talking about one option, and energetic when talking about the other.” 


There might be something that needs to be said aloud, an elephant in the room that needs to be addressed, before U can genuinely attune to your conversation partner—like “I’m angry” or “I’m afraid” or even simply saying, “I’m bored right now!”


Mary says that whenever she’s “bored in a conversation, it’s usually because either I or the other person aren’t revealing much about ourselves.” 


Sometimes, there’s a mismatch between someone’s explicit words and the feeling or vibe of what they are saying. Noticing that and naming it (“ur words sound reasonable, but U seem angry to me!”) can really shift the character of a conversation.


Navigation and Boundaries
U are the sovereign of your own attention! Just because someone is talking to, at U does not oblige U to give them your attention! 


Interrupting is a great listening tool. If what they share is not pleasant for U to listen to, U can interject with a reflection, observation, or question that steers the conversation in a direction that would be more satisfying for U.


If U get distracted, it’s okay to simply say “Sorry, I got a little distracted there. Would U mind repeating that?” People will generally appreciate your honesty, and the care U show by genuinely trying to understand what they are communicating.


One sort of morally-grey-area trick: it’s okay to sometimes indulge in the possibility of not actually listening, if someone is talking at U, if what they are saying feels irrelevant, not resonant, unimportant to U. U can just let their words wash over U without making effort to pay attention or follow their meaning. 


A kinder, albeit higher challenge level and more uncomfortable version of this approach, is to be honest, saying something like: “I’m not really listening right now.” “I don’t want to listen to this.” “I don’t have the attention span to listen to U right now.” This honesty can also be a bid for connection.


In practice, there are often a lot of situations where people want to talk at U, where what they are saying feels irrelevant, and U don’t necessarily need to listen. U can listen in those circumstances, but U don’t need to. U can just not do stuff.
Conclusion
Listening is an act of love. Simply to listen deeply to someone is already an act of great kindness, a service to them and the world. We can give this gift to anyone at any time, at no expense and with great benefit.


What helps U to listen well? What helps U to listen effectively, deeply, lovingly? 


May U deeply listen to others. May others feel seen and heard in your presence. May U receive the same care and attention U give, and may our shared love benefit all beings. ❤️

Reading
or, the subtle and mysterious art of consistently finding and immediately reading the exact-perfect-for-U-right-now book


when i was a child, reading was everything. books took me to worlds i delighted to imagine, answered questions i didn’t know i had. and they were, above all, the friends that i needed, at a time in my life when i often had trouble finding or keeping them.


my parents had a strong influence on me, in this way. the house was filled with books, piles and piles and shelves and shelves. my parents were both always reading. in the morning: newspapers by the kitchen table. in the evening: my dad on his couch, my mom in her bed. reading reading reading. children mimic their parents, and i took to reading like a fish in water. 


  



when i was interested in a topic, i would always check out every book i could find on it at the library. i remember a few areas of interest that i did this with—chess, several times over. detectives and detective agencies. writing and journalism. and always fiction. stories stories stories. 


  



when we went to the bookstore, my mom and i had a deal. she would buy all the books i wanted, as long as i read them. bless her.


when i was sixteen, i had most of the summer to do with what i pleased. i posted on Ask Metafilter about what i should do to make the most of my time. a number of people mentioned reading as much as I could, and one person in particular suggested making my way through some of the books on the reading list at St. John’s College. i poked through their website—built in ASP at the time?—and fell in love with the premise of the school. “too bad i’ll never go there,” i thought to myself—held in the grasp of some limiting belief, i suppose. 


i promptly forgot about it until the following year, when my mother suggested that i have a go at reading Colleges That Change Lives by Loren Pope, which featured her alma mater and also the one that would become mine—St. John’s. the College had rolling admissions; i applied the fall of my Senior Year and got in two weeks later.


the four years i spent at St. John’s were, in many ways, among the happiest periods of my life. i loved the books we read, reading them and discussing them and writing about them. i fell in love with Plato and Cervantes, George Eliot and Virginia Woolf. best of all, i had no trouble making friends. i was finally surrounded by people who loved to read as much as i did. i felt at home there in a way i’d never quite felt in my hometown.


that time of my life was also, to date, the period that i read the most. books on the program of studies, and books off of it. i read as much as anyone else, and often more. i was an ultramarathoner, loping mile after mile—turning page after page, book after book. 


i’ve tracked my reading on Goodreads since i first started using it in high school. in 2011, i started doing their “Reading Challenges”—annual attempts to hit a goal of reading a certain number of books that year[1]. over the years, i’ve had more and more misgivings about Goodreads as an interface, but i’ve kept up filing which books i’ve read, and i’ve kept a challenge going each year.


some of the years at St. John’s, i read a hundred or more books a year. when i graduated, things changed. i still read a lot, but not nearly as much as i had been. in 2014, the year after i graduated, my reading rate slid to 61 books a year. in 2016, i hit an all-time low of 32. in 2018, i managed to read 87 books. in 2023, last year, i read 42.


when i trained at a monastery, it was significantly less of an intellectual environment. i was encouraged to meditate in my free time, rather than read books. i still read, though. i read as much as if not more than anyone else there. especially when i got obsessed with military strategy.


my current way of living, on what i call my pilgrimage, can make reading challenging. i don't have a home, and i limit how many physical objects i own and carry with me quite a bit. i certainly can't have a reading room or a library of my own filled with piles and piles of books. i keep at most one or two physical books with me, and read the majority of books i read on my phone or iPad.


i guess this post comes from a kind of wistfulness. i’ve missed the years of my life where i read a hundred books a year. i love how books have shaped me, and i’ve wanted to open my heart and life to that influence even more. to rekindle a relationship with reading, to rediscover and rebuild an identity with books as a central part of my life. 


zooming out, i’m not alone. in 2021, Venkatesh Rao tweeted that before the internet, he probably read “a couple of hundred books a year,” but now he reads “maybe a couple of dozen. Reading books is just so slow.”


there’s a million new sources of information and entertainment, and they are increasingly compelling. meanwhile, U can certainly find a number of people who will claim attention spans are decreasing and cases of attention deficit disorders are increasing. from that perspective, i’m so screwed. call it cope, but i prefer to think that we spent the last several decades creating an ever-increasing abundance of digital information and we haven't quite worked out how to flow with that yet.


in a way, my intentions with reading have been similar to those i wrote in a newsletter essay last year, tasshin can meditate as a treat. both meditation and reading have been in a similar state of affairs for me. they are activities i have done a lot of, have loved very deeply, and then somewhere along the line something got twisted and stopped working smoothly for me.


for the last couple of months, i’ve read furiously. there have been days where more or less all i’ve done is read. a few puzzle pieces have finally fit together, and i feel like i’ve largely reshaped my relationship with reading.


this post will articulate what's helped me to do so, both the perspectives i've cultivated and techniques i’ve practiced. by writing them down, i can cement myself in them, establish them clearly in my habits and my life, and return to them as needed. i want this essay to give me context and motivation to read, and to lean towards a future where i read more and more.


i also hope that these words will help others to do the same, should they resonate with what i aspire to and find the suggestions i make here helpful.
how exactly u go about finding the right book at the right time
U know that phrase, the right book at the right time? for a reader, it’s the best feeling in the world. as my friend Isabel says, it’s a drug.


i love the feeling of reading a book that i absolutely must read or i will die. a page turner i can’t put down. the right book at the right time, hand-picked by God Himself for the benefit of Urs Truly.


if i am ridiculously excited about a book, it feels like the most important thing in the world, and my attention is endless. i can read for hours and hours, days and days.


if this book is fiction, it’s an incredible tale well told. or, if it’s nonfiction, it’s usually a book that is helping me to answer a question that’s actively alive, that i am burning with curiosity to answer.


there’s a state of mind, a way of seeing, that has helped me to read more often, to magnetize a book i love into my orbit and then obsessively read it.


to find the right book at the right time, U must first believe, with faith in your heart, that there is a right book at every time—that for any given chapter of your life, there is a perfect book for U—yes, this very moment, right now.


in my experience, i’ve never found the exact-perfect-for-U-right-now book with my head, by thinking about what book i should read, or trying to read the same books everyone else has read. i find the perfect book for me with my heart, my gut, my body. not as a problem to solve, but a chance to dance with the world and the whole universe.


Marie Kondo is famous for her method of cleaning and organzing, based on only keeping objects that “spark joy.” these are objects that, when U physically touch them, bring joy and happiness into your body. U literally feel happy in your body. U can’t judge a book by its cover, but U can judge it by how holding it in your hands and turning its pages make U feel in your body. 


recently i went to a bookstore looking for a book to read. i decided to try an experiment. i put into the field, the heartspace, of the bookstore, what i was looking for. i told the bookstore with my heart that i wanted something physically small, short. i was looking for a novel with a compelling use of language and a plot that would be fun to read, compelling. something that would inspire my own fiction practice, something new, that would shake things up.


as i looked through the books in the shelves, i found a novel that was a pretty slim volume, had a pretty cover that called to me. the description on the back seemed like it might do the job. i read the first page and the poetry of its prose made me feel like, yep, this is it. 


my head thought it was sorta risky. it seemed silly to buy a book i'd not heard of before. the book was $17 and that seemed kinda expensive for my budget for a book i didn't know for sure i was gonna read. but my heart and hands said, this is the one.


i read it furiously over the next couple of days and i loved it. it was just what i was looking for.


and, in a weird twist of fate and further evidence that time is weird, a few weeks later i was browsing a different bookstore, and i found one of those little “staff recommends” cards recommending the book i’d found. if i’d read that recommendation card several weeks earlier, i would have absolutely picked that book as the one. glad i picked it even without the recommendation!


  

how to make sure u actually read the right book at the right time
here are a number of tips and suggestions that i’ve heard of or found for reading. these are phrased as advice to myself, speaking to myself, but it may resonate with U as well. obviously, feel free to disregard any advice that doesn’t feel like it resonates for U. 


be the kinda guy who reads every day. aim to read some of a book every day, even just a little bit.


when U are actively interested in a book, start reading it. strike while the iron is hot. if it’s a physical book, read the first few pages, or even just the first page. if U want to read digitally, send Urself a free sample on Amazon (or find through other means) so U can read the first few chapters. or, if money’s not a concern, buy it straight away and start reading a little bit of it immediately. 


if someone recommends a book to U, it’s not a binary decision, to read the book or not. U could, for example, read the first 10 pages of the book and see how it lands for U. or skim the whole thing quickly to get a sense of it.


U can skim books! i give U permission! U can always return to read more, or to read the entirety of the book.


U can cheat on that book your not reading with a book U actually want to read. if U find that U aren’t genuinely enjoying a book, feel free to set it aside for a time or quit it entirely—no matter how much U think U should be enjoying it, how much U think logically or rationally U stand to benefit from reading it. it’s just not doing it for U, princess. it’s not alive.


if u aren't reading it immediately, if U can't help urself but read it straight away, right now, today, it ain't the exact-perfect-for-U-right-now book!


when U read a book, try to finish a complete chapter or section, so that a complete idea or plotline has been expressed, and so that U have a clear stopping point ot come back to.


U love novels! U love stories! U love tales! always be reading at least one novel.


have at least one physical book U are actively interested in reading with U at any given time. physically carry it with U. bring it on walks or to appointments.


if U want, U can take Urself to the bookstore, buy Urself a stack of books, and immediately start reading the one that excites U most. U can afford it! there are some really good books out there! enjoy!!


my ideal way to read would be to have a physical copy of every book i was interested in in a space immediately near me at all times. to have a home filled with books. but i do not own a home.


my hosts typically have books in their homes, and more often than not, the books they’re interested in are interesting to me, too. U can make use of the affordances that are presently available to U by reading the resonant books of the people U stay with.


if, unlike me, U have a home U call your own, please take advantage of it. buy books. buy lots of books. buy more books. future Tasshin—if U ever own a home, please fill it with piles and piles and piles of books. thank U. 


  



given the constraints of my life, digital books are generally more serviceable. one nice thing about buying ebooks through Amazon as opposed to acquiring them elsewhere is that Readwise can automatically import your notes and highlights, and also, if U like, automatically export them into a notetaking tool of your choice, like Tana.


U can start a book group to discuss a book if U want to make sure U read it! inviting a few friends who will find the book interesting, too, can make it easier to start and finish a book that is challenging or dense, but rewarding.


sometimes if i really want to read something, but it’s challenging or a little aversive, i can motivate myself by alternating between doing the high effort but fun good thing (reading the book) and doing something fun, easy, low-effort and motivating (watching an episode of a TV series i’m enjoying).


Cedric Chin’s “land and expand” reading strategy is terrific if there’s a topic U want to learn more about:
1. “land” on / start with narrative non-fiction about topics you're interested in reading; can read these when tired/low-energy
2. “expand” into difficult material when U have the opportunity for focused attention
3. execute this program in parallel. can read multiple books at once, at multiple difficulty levels


or, more simply, as Isabel puts it, “have a book that feels easy to read and a book that feels challenging going at the same time.”


when U read a non-fiction book, and it has exercises, and U really want to get value out of the book, make sure U actually do the exercises. i know, it takes time and effort. but that's where the real value lies.


think of it like making and taking an online course just for U. hold Urself accountable. practice self-discipline. it's okay to skip boring exercises or remix others to make them more interesting. bask in the value of what U learn. have fun.


oh, U have a crush on a girl? yep, it's a Tuesday. in any case the best thing to do if U have a crush is to read every book they recommend to U.


i love Shelby Smith’s suggestion to use pictures of your friends as bookmarks.


i have become the kind of guy who reads books while walking. i love being outside, i love walking, and i love reading. reading books while walking hits that spot for me. (i also love writing while walking. i do my best writing when my legs and the whole world are in it alongside my heart. i’m writing this very paragraph while walking.)


the key to being able to read while walking is expanded awareness. U have to see and hear and feel the whole world around u, even as U place your attention on the book in front of U (whether it's a physical book or a digital book on your smartphone). if U’ve no idea what i’m talking about, go and take Michael Ashcroft's course on Alexander Technique already.


oh, now that i think about it, a certain baseline of self-love also helps. i love myself! i love to read! i love walking, and i love reading while walking! i don't feel especially self-conscious doing it. i don't mind if someone else thinks if i look silly for it. i love myself anyway!
conclusion
may U always love reading. may U always find the exact-perfect-for-U-right now book. may what U read bring U joy and benefit, may it take U to beautiful imaginary worlds and transform your real life for the better ❤️

Online Courses
Tiago Forte’s course Building a Second Brain was the first online, cohort-based course I’d ever taken. I was considering taking the fourth iteration of the course. At the time, it would cost me $800 to join, which felt like a lot of money to me. I’d repressed the desire to take it, thinking that it was too much money.


Then I remember meditating one night a few days before the course was going to start and having a sudden sense of intense urgency. Some part of me was screaming, “Hey! No! It’s really important that U take this course! It may feel like expensive, but U have the money to do so, and U can take it! It’s worth it! Do it!”


Granted, cohort-based courses, like many other products and services, often work on an artificial sense of urgency to market and sell themselves, but that part of me was right. I signed up for the course, and I’m so glad I did. 


Not only was the material in the course helpful—I learned so many ideas and practices that have helped me in my digital life and work since—but it led to so many other good things. 


The extensive notes I started taking formed the basis of my blog and lots of other writing (including this book). Since it led to work opportunities and projects (including working with Tiago himself later on), the course literally paid for itself. And I met some lifelong friends and collaborators, including Ben Mosior and James Stuber.


Online courses are a novel learning medium in our contemporary world. Unlike questions, conversations, or books, they’ve only been around for decades.


Online courses are of course inspired in many ways by courses at universities and other schools, but they differ in some pretty fundamental ways.


The courses I’ve taken have been of largely two kinds: a synchronized, cohort-based course, or asynchronous, take-on-ur-own and at-ur-own-pace. 


U may find that U have a preference between one or the other, or that one kind suits a specific kind of learning goal that U have rather than another.


For myself, I’ve come to prefer to take courses that I can take at my own pace and my own. Cohort-based courses are often more expensive, and feel higher pressure. I also don’t really like group Zoom calls, especially with lectures. Asynchronous courses feel calmer—I can literally take them at whatever pace I feel like. Often, I will dip in and out of self-paced courses rather than do them all at once in big chunks. 


I often feel hesitation before purchasing an online course, like I did before taking Building a Second Brain back in 2017. Courses can be expensive—often anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars! 


That said, if a course is aligned with my goals, and I have reason to believe the instructors know what they’re talking about and can create a curriculum that achieves what they promise, I think it’s worth it to pay for the course. Plus, if I compare the price of one online course to the price tag of my college education, it’s usually quite affordable, comparatively speaking.


When I take an online course, I’ve found it important to define success on my own terms. It’s not always the case, but I’ve found that teachers and instructors often bring in a pretty heavy frame of what success in their course looks like—typically based on what worked for them personally, or what’s worked in the past as they’ve taught other students. While there is a reason they see things the way they do, it’s been freeing for me to safeguard my right to redefine success on my own terms. Maybe I have a simpler goal, or a more ambitious goal. Maybe I don’t care about entire sections of what they’re teaching, or want to augment what I’m learning with additional materials and challenges. It’s all good!


If U learn how to approach online courses in a way that works for U, they can complement your other learning endeavors quite nicely. There are often topics and approaches covered in contemporary courses that U can’t easily learn through a book or any other method.






________________
Learning Journey: Writing
I can’t remember a time where writing wasn’t a part of my life, a part of my dreams. As a kid, I wrote stories about imaginary worlds and heroes. I dreamed of being a journalist after reading a book about journalism as a career. The summer camp I went to had a daily “newspaper” and I wrote for it every year. What I wrote was embarrassingly simple and naïve, but we all start somewhere.


When I started using the internet, I wrote little blog posts on a myriad of ever-changing platforms. After puberty, I went through an obligatory phase of writing really bad poetry about my sadnesses and my romantic longings. Later, in high school, I dreamed of writing The Great American Novel.


My teachers encouraged me, my writing, my dreams. In high school, Mr. Struzziero (“Struzz”), an English teacher, gave me early, inspiring encouragement about some of my essays—and critical feedback when my pieces weren’t up to snuff. Ms. O’Connor, a history teacher, helped me revise draft after draft of an essay on the 1953 Iranian Coup and its relation to the concept of “Blowback,” which I submitted to some kind of academic competition. Ms. Roth, my AP English teacher, pushed me to strengthen my ability to analyze literature, and tolerated my predilection for willfully, creatively misunderstanding assignments.


At St. John’s, this trend continued. As my freshman year came to a close, I didn’t feel called to get a job or an internship, as most of my peers were doing. Instead, I raised money with a Kickstarter to continue my learning in a self-directed way. I wrote all summer, and collected my writings into a book of essays called An Autodidact that I self-published.


My Sophomore Language tutor, Ms. Printz, took me aside early in the year and suggested that I write an extra paper for her each week, and that we meet to talk about what I wrote. I don’t really know what moved her to do this, what she saw in me that inspired this offer, but I’m so grateful she did. 


  



With Ms. Printz’ guidance, I stretched myself, exploring new genres and territories. I wrote a creative fiction piece I still love, called Andrew on Jenny, that expressed in a poetic way how I felt about women, with humiliating, tender autobiographical stories and pretentious allusions to philosophical concepts.


She also helped me learn to do close readings of passages, focusing intense analysis on short passages, like the story of Babel—a mere 11 verses, that I wrote my entire annual essay on that year. 


That year, I developed the habit of writing more than I needed to. My senior language tutor, Ms. Haigney, said in a Don Rag—a recurring meeting where tutors give an oral report on your participation and work, as a form of evaluation—“If I ask Mr. Fogleman for a one page paper, he writes five. If I ask him for a five page paper, he writes ten. Once, he even handed in two papers instead of one.”


In my last semester at St. John’s, I wrote my senior essay—on self-knowledge in Plato’s Phaedrus—as well as several other pieces of similar length and depth, which I was even more proud of: a comedic essay about the film Being There; an extended analysis of Virginia Woolf’s The Waves; and an experimental piece, exploring new language for rendering some of my phenomenological experiences of emotions and time, conveying vivid gestalts through exploratory uses of words and sentences.


From the beginning of my time at St. John’s, I aspired to be one of several writing assistants—older students who people could come to with questions about their essays and assignments, for support in the writing process. I admired one of the writing assistants, Tyler Fanning, and asked him for advice about how to become one one day, too. He suggested I read prize-winning annual essays, tutors’ lectures (delivered weekly on Fridays as an exception to the default of conversation-based classes, which U could optionally attend, or read later when they were shared in print in the libraries), and suggested a few writing books to read, like Francis-Noël Thomas and Mark Turner’s Clear and Simple as the Truth, an extended treatise about the classic prose style.


It took until my senior year, but eventually I was brought on as a writing assistant by the head of that program, Mr. Pastille. He was a great boss, in that he was mostly pretty hands off—we received very little training as such, and I was empowered to trust my own intuition and sense for what each student requesting assistance needed, about how to support them. I also got to attend some workshops that he hosted, about his view on the writing process, which was very instructive and inspiring for me.


As I neared graduation, I remember a pivotal conversation I had with Ms. Haigney. We were sitting on a bench not far from my dormitory, on a warm spring summer day. I was expressing uncertainty about what to do after graduating, what to do with my life, and I asked her for her advice. I had expressed a desire to be a writer, and perhaps a sense of nebulosity and confusion about what exactly that entailed or how to go about it, in a professional way.


She made a very sensible and practical suggestion: that I go out and get some valuable life experience, and then return to writing when I had something to say about those experiences. She mentioned a specific author, Sebastian Junger, who had taken this path with his own writing, about topics like war and dangerous occupations.


I proceeded to adopt more or less consciously for the next decade or so of my life, as I traveled in Asia, trained at a monastery, and did an assortment of odd jobs and endeavors, resulting in excellent fodder for an abundance of writing about… *gestures widely at my blog and books*.


In my twenties, after graduating, I had a number of different writing projects:
* I wrote a blog on Quora about Heidegger and phenomenology, that virtually no one read, except for an obscure, independent scholar I’d made internet friends with. 
* I wrote a travel blog about my trips in Asia with my friend Ulysse.
* I collaborated with my teacher, Soryu Forall, on a self-published book about his teachings, Maple Seeds. 
* I hand-wrote an autobiographical book about my relationship to spirituality, meditation, monasticism, and the Bodhisattva Vows, called Here to Serve. 
* I did some guest blogging for Tiago Forte on his blog, Praxis, about productivity related topics.
* I started an early version of my current blog, that adopted a heavy-handed, authoritative, black-and-white tone, before realizing that was a non-starter, and eventually pivoting to my current approach—first on Medium, and later on my own domain.


Tiago’s course, Building a Second Brain, led me to collect an abundance of notes on a variety of topics. I tried to make sense of how all these topics and interests fit together, and turned to writing to do so. After that, it was natural to begin sharing what I learned and found in my explorations with others. This trend paired well with taking David Perell’s Write of Passage course. 


Posts like Meditation Tips for a Lifetime of Practice or The Strategic Theory of John Boyd became the bread and butter of my blog for so many years, what I call “informational blog posts.”


A big turning point was when I first had Visa on my podcast in 2021, I asked him about why he was writing books, how his different projects fit together. At the time, he’d been agonizing on the timeline about his second book—the since published INTROSECT. 


Before I asked, it wasn’t really obvious to me why he was writing a book. It seemed to me like he could do a lot of things with his time. Why this?


I don't say it explicitly in the conversation, but I remember it dawning on me as he answered— “Ohhhhh, I should write a book about mettā! I keep saying all the same stuff to people about this meditation technique, and I've never heard anyone explain it quite like I do… I really ought to write those explanations out in a book."


His answer inspired me to write The Path of Love, which I started shortly after and published the following year (2022). That, in turn, inspired me to write The Path of Empowerment with Mary in 2023, and then to write this book, The Path of Curiosity in 2024! It also set the stage for me to start writing fiction and novels, something I write about in another Learning Journey chapter in this book.


This is how I would explain now what I learned in this moment, as Visa answered, and in the course of writing these three books in successive years: it's worth writing a book, if only to clarify and articulate at length how U think about the things that matter most to U. Sharing your thinking with others is a bonus.


Clarity of conceptual models, in a way that's been time-tested across many conversations, that is eloquent and well-articulated—which is arguably what a book is—is a disproportionately valuable lever to have available. 


That summer, I also did a stint working with Sasha Chapin as a writing coach. I felt like I’d gotten into a rut with my writing, by pidgeon-holing myself into the informational blog post genre. I loved those blog posts, but I knew I could do more as a writer, and I sensed that Sasha could help me out of it. 


I wanted to gain some new skills as a writer; I wanted to get into storytelling, to write and share some of the most important stories in my life; and I wanted to have fun doing it. Sasha immediately understood what I was looking for and suggested that I work on three skills with him, and gave me writing prompts to work on those specific skills. That resulted in the pieces I published as Once Upon a Cheesesteak and The World’s Best Pavlok Story[2].


In John McPhee’s book on writing, Draft No. 4, he talks about what his long-time editor at The New Yorker, William Shawn, described as the process of “find[ing] out what kind of writers they are”:
The writing impulse seeks its own level and isn’t always given a chance to find it. You can’t make up your mind in a Comp Lit class that you’re going to be a Russian novelist. Or even an American novelist. Or a poet. Young writers find out what kinds of writers they are by experiment. If they choose from the outset to practice exclusively a form of writing because it is praised in the classroom or otherwise carries appealing prestige, they are vastly increasing the risk inherent in taking up writing in the first place. It is so easy to misjudge yourself and get stuck in the wrong genre. You avoid that, early on, by writing in every genre. If you are telling yourself you’re a poet, write poems. Write a lot of poems. If fewer than one work out, throw them all away; you’re not a poet. Maybe you’re a novelist. You won’t know until you have written several novels.


I have long thought that Ben Jonson summarized the process when he said, “Though a man be more prone and able for one kind of writing than another, yet he must exercise all.” Gender aside, I take that to be a message to young writers.


I certainly needed to do a lot of experimenting over the years, to find my voice and my stride as a writer—from early, immature experiments; developing strength as a writer in an intellectual  and academic context, and then graduating from that context, letting go of it; summarizing my studies and explorations in blog posts, and then beginning to innovate, to find words and genres that fit my own authentic expression. 


I work on all kinds of projects these days, from making music videos to interviewing people on my podcast. These projects draw on an enormous breadth of skills and capacities. But I've always felt that words are my core gift, writing my main art form. 


Writing, for me, is like breathing. If I’m living, if I’m thinking, I want to write about my experience, my world. 
________________
Writing
I’ve written a lot of genres over the years. What I call “informational blog posts” are my bread and butter. I’ve also written fiction, including short stories and some novellas. I’ve written long-form nonfiction, like this book, or its companion pieces on Love and Empowerment. Or my personal favorite, shitposts on Twitter.


I've never regretted taking the time to write at length about my thoughts and feelings about a given topic. 


When I feel blocked—emotionally, psychologically, creatively, in my life as a whole—the best way I've found to resolve it is to write down literally everything on my heart, and to share everything that wants to be shared where it wants to be heard. 


Over the last few years, I’ve written a number of books. At some point, I set the intention to  always be working on at least one book project at a time for the rest of my life. 


One of the best gifts I give myself as a writer is prolific tweeting. Usually when I'm ready to write a longform piece about something, I have a handful of tweets and threads about the same topic. Twitter search lets me find, choose, and copy/paste the relevant material. It’s so easy to just copy and paste tweets and threads into a Google Doc until one day the momentum magically transforms it into an essay or a book.


Another big thing that helps me in my writing process is knowing the relationship between speaking and writing. As humans, we learn to listen and speak years before we learn to read and write. Every time we speak about something, we’re basically organizing our thoughts about it, getting clear about how we see something. It’s like an early first draft of an essay or a book.


U can even literally draft a first draft of an essay by speaking it, and transcribing it with one of the new-fangled software tools they didn’t have when I was a kid.


The process of writing is valuable in itself, of course, and sharing my writing online has led to so many magical things, in both dead-obvious expected and miracle-unexpected ways. 
Writing With Questions
An underrated move in writing (and thinking) is simply listing questions for urself, and then answering them.


If U actually do this, U will find that two related moves are helpful to learn and have handy, as well:
1. ordering your questions, in a logical order, or one that makes sense to U intuitively—so that the resulting answers flow neatly from one to the other with a kind of coherence
2. including the text of the question in your answer, so that when U remove the structuring questions the answers still make sense


For example, instead of:


"Where did U go to college?"


"St. John's!"


U do this (or something similar):


"I went to college at St. John's."


If U deploy all four of these moves: listing questions, ordering them, answering them, including the question in the answer—U can pretty straightforwardly generate a coherent, excellent first draft.


I've written many hundreds of pieces this way, drawing on these moves. It's impossible to have a blank page or complete writer's block if U can generate a list of questions that U have answers to bubbling out of U, that U have something to say about.


It can be helpful to source questions from friends (or internet strangers)—or to notice the questions people are already often asking U—and include those in your list.


As i've begun writing fiction, I was delighted to discover that this approach also works there. U can ask questions of your characters and world, and answer them, and then use those answers as the basis of scenes or chapters


This is also how I do my podcast! I list questions for my guests, order them, and then... ask them! It’s a simple recipe for excellent interviews.
Writing Tips
Here are some other things that have helped me to write a lot, and to enjoy doing so:
* Keeping lists of things I want to write about, and placeholder docs for collecting notes, sentences, paragraphs etc.
* Having as many venues to write in as possible, with different pros/cons
* Lots of notes and note-taking
* Extreme Twitter use, search
* Talking a lot about the things I want to think and write about. Knowing who I can talk to about what. Recording myself speaking, to use as rough drafts (can transcribe, or just use to recall). 
* Knowing that something small (as small as a scribbled note to self, or a tweet) can be a part of a larger piece. Building things up over time, tweets -> threads -> essays, newsletters, blogs... books
* Having a formal process / workflow for moving blog posts through stages (see the chapter Managing Learning Flow below)
* Good outlining skills. ordering things in the right order before I even start
* Scheduling regular meetings with a friend to write
* Collaborating with other people on specific pieces, who are co-authors as well as accountability buddies. 
* Asking for lots of feedback, as external interactions help me stay motivated
* Starting with the easiest possible publication options (Twitter, Medium, Mailchimp) and then only later migrating to my own blog. I see a lot of tech-y people getting blocked on choosing a venue, making their own configs or worse, tools. 
* Working with writing mentors, coaches; taking writing courses


Writing With a Collaborator[a]
When I co-authored and self-published a book with my friend and collaborator Mary Bajorek (The Path of Empowerment), here’s the process we used: 
* Decide we were going to write a book together and agree on the project intention, scope, roles, constraints
* Create an initial outline for the book with possible chapters
* Start filling and expanding the outline with relevant tweets, notes, ideas
* Announce book and make the book publicly available for reading, comments, early feedback
* Set loose intentions for who would be primarily responsible for which parts of the book, or which would be co-authored
* Meet each week for 90 minutes:
   * Talk about one chapter of the book together for 30 minutes, both sharing our perspective on the topic. 
   * Pick which chapters we were going to write that week, and co-work for 60 minutes working on different parts of the book. (usually one of us would start writing on each of them). 
   * While writing, listen to music together (usually an EDM set) in sync (made it fun, felt like we were in it together even though writing separate books)
* As chapters finish, publish them separately as blog posts if independently useful 
* Trust any weird and funky ideas about what would be a cool addition to add to the book, something that would make it fun and enjoyable for us to write and to read
* Upon hitting first draft stage, shift into editing. move all superfluous or less polished material to a separate doc ("Cutting Board")
* Polish, edit, reorganize what remains repeatedly
* Have a book launch party!


I stay motivated to write partly for my own enjoyment—I really love writing, and the pieces I’ve written—and partly out of the desire to serve others, to benefit them through the information I share or bring them joy with the stories I craft.

Thinking
In Plato's Theaetetus, Socrates offers a definition of thinking:
[Thinking is] speech that the soul itself goes through with itself about whatever it considers. Of course it’s as one who doesn’t know that I’m declaring it to you. For it has this look to me, that when it’s thinking the soul is doing nothing other than conversing, asking itself questions and answering them itself, and affirming and denying. (189E)
Perhaps, as U read this quote, it doesn’t mean very much to you. I know that was the case for me, when I first read it. But over time this passage has completely changed my way of thinking.
At the time, I was very interested in questions like "What is philosophy? Am I a philosopher? How can I be a better thinker? How can I be a better writer?” 
I realized that if thinking was simply conversation, then it gave me a clear way to practice being a reader or a writer. I realized that I could practice thinking simply by having a conversation. I could ask myself questions and answer them, in my mind or out loud. I could ask other people questions and hear their answers, or have other people ask me questions and answer them.
Of course, I had already been doing these things for years. But not intentionally. Not deliberately. For me, this was a dramatically different way of approaching thought and writing. And it has changed my thinking and writing process ever since.
________________
Interviewing
The very first episode of the Guru Viking podcast is an interview with Lorin Roche (the first of many on that podcast). While discussing his early history as a meditation teacher, he describes having two hour conversations that he called doing a full spiritual inventory—asking meditators questions like “What spark in U led U to begin meditating? When did U start to feel like this isn’t working any more?” and listening. 


I found his whole process and perspective fascinating, but one aside in particular that he said really stayed with me: “Nobody had ever listened to these people. Meditators require that. They deserve it. They deserve it and they need it and nobody ever gets it.”


The format he suggested there, and the tone in his voice when he said it—“They deserve it”—inspired me very deeply and has stayed with me since I first heard this episode.


I absolutely agree that meditators deserve this kind of love and attention—and more and more, I feel that everyone does, that your life is a beautiful piece of art that deserves deep witnessing regardless of who U are or how you've lived.


  





In a lot of ways, my podcast is my school, my guests are my teachers, and I am sharing my ongoing, continual education with the world.


Being a listener is actually a role U can actively embody. Pay attention. Expand your awareness. Watch the speaker. Make eye contact. Nod your head when U agree. Smile when U are happy. Make facial expressions to indicate how U feel. Wish them well in your heart, cheer them on. Raise your hand or speak your voice, participate actively, audibly, visibly when it makes sense, is welcome, feels good.


Good speakers anticipate, desire listeners like this, will make eye contact with them, feel supported by them, ride the wave of their energy and attention to bring out their best. 


When it comes to interviewing, I'm in the “ask really good questions I’m genuinely curious about and then get the fuck out of the way” school of thought. Some people approach interviews more like conversations, where they share their own perspective, opinions, experiences. I will often transition my podcast episodes into more of a conversation towards the end of the recording, but in general, I like to stick to asking questions and deeply listening to the answers. 


Increasingly, one of the things I'm most interested in as an interviewer is my own phenomenology as I have a conversation, ask questions, follow my curiosity—what choices I make because of it, and how that affects the aliveness, quality, and meaningfulness of the conversation.


How questions arise. How I know when to ask a particular question. Attunement to rhythm. The expansion and contraction of awareness. Body language. Patterns arising, bursting. What aliveness feels like. How my body experiences curiosity, or the stacking and ordering questions. What I read in the other.


Listening is a gift we can give anyone at any time, at no expense and with great benefit.




everyone is endlessly fascinating if u know how to watch and listen and ask questions. to pay attention this deeply to who someone is, how they show up in the world, what their past and dreams are, is an act of tremendous love, healing, and potential

Skill Trees
Skill trees are fundamental to how I think about learning and teaching. A skill tree is a mental model that sequences the skills needed to master a larger skillset, e.g. that it makes sense to learn addition before multiplication, or geometry and algebra before calculus. 


I first encountered skill trees explicitly when I started using Khan Academy in the 2010’s. At the time, Salman Khan’s videos and the Khan Academy website were built around a very thoughtful sequencing of skills with mathematics and other areas. U could see where U were on the skill tree, and as U developed new skills—which was surprisingly easy and rewarding, given that they were appropriate for your current skill level—that would motivate U to progress further.


  



I realized that my teachers in my formal education had made use of skill trees, too, but those skill trees were implicit—the teachers hadn’t really made that skill tree legible in a useful way to me as a learner. When I struggled with specific skills, they didn’t always investigate what prerequisites I might be missing or shaky on. But with Khan Academy, I could go back and work on the prerequisites I found difficult. Once I did, the later skills would feel a lot more manageable, and I would progress more quickly.


Later, I saw that skill trees applied in other domains. They had been built into many of the video games I loved, for example—sequencing different technological developments or upgrades in a way that made the plot and gameplay more engaging. My friend and longtime collaborator James Stuber and I developed a model of a productivity skill tree together before building the Digital Productivity Coach together. And as my meditation practice deepened, I became interested in how various meditation skills and practices related to each other, and developed various models that I could use to teach others meditation.


Some other skill trees I’ve made since then include The Path of Love Skill Tree and The Quest Map (which is a kind of skill tree for my Empowerment work).


A skill tree is just one map of the territory. Other skills are relevant, and the suggested sequencing in a given skill tree may not be the one that U need personally. U may discover areas of the territory that aren’t mapped. U may need to make a different skill tree entirely. But it helps to have one.


As a learner, I thrive when there is an explicit, legible skill tree. It's even better when it feels like the teacher makes space for me to indicate how I understand myself in relation to the skill tree, and even to expand or alter the map of the territory.


Conversely, I really struggle when a learning environment lacks an explicit, legible skill tree. It's even harder when it feels like the teacher lacks an implicit skill tree, or that their model of the skill tree misses me and where I am at.


It’s worth looking for skill trees in areas you’re interested in learning, and using those in your studies. It’s also helpful to maintain a sense of any discrepancies between your experiences or goals and the skill trees you’ve been offered, so that U can develop your own model of the skill tree if needed.


As a teacher, it’s worth tracking your sense of the skill tree, and actively comparing students to where U think they are in the skill tree, so that U can help them more effectively and also refine your model in general. It is a kindness to share your skill trees with your students, so that they can understand and visualize your map of the territory, and orient towards how they want to approach learning with you.


As someone who shares knowledge and skills with others, who tries to pass on what I've learned along the way in the days of my own life, to spread what has benefitted me so that it might benefit others also: I strive to develop my internal model of the skill tree, and to make it explicit, legible, useful as soon as possible.


I think of skill acquisition with this model:
Skill Acquisition → 
Skill Growth →
Skill Maintenance → 
Skill Combination


I think it's always worth exploring at least a little bit of a creative medium U feel called to. Dipping your toes in the water for a few hours. Not needing to make anything good, just getting a feel for what it's like, expanding your horizons of what's possible.


I am even more excited by the idea of developing competence at a large number and unusual set of skills, and then connecting them together in novel and unique ways, than I am by the idea of developing mastery and excellence at one or even several skills.


When I learn new skills, I likely aspire to combine them with other skills that I have (writing, making visual art, making music, leadership, etc.) in a way that fits into my larger vision and plans and strategy.

Learning Journey: Drawing, Visual Art, and Procreate
In late 2021, I started drawing and making digital art with Procreate on my iPad. I had been watching Sílvia use it to make art. Procreate uses progressive disclosure in its user interface, so that its more powerful features are hidden until U want to use them. The most basic interface is quite simple to use: brushes, colors, and the canvas, all controlled with the miraculous Apple Pencil. I thought, wow, I could do that!
I didn't go to art school like Sílvia had. I didn't have years of drawing experience under my belt. Even as a kid, I'd always been kind of bad at drawing. But Procreate just looked like so much fun. I had to try making visual art myself with it.
I set about doing a Do 100 Thing challenge to make 100 pieces of visual art in Procreate.
I intentionally made the first piece as bad as I possibly could, to set the bar as low as possible. I could only get better! Quality didn't really matter with my pieces! I just wanted to have fun!
And it was fun! Procreate felt like the coolest toy in the world. Even though my drawings looked "bad," I had so much fun making them, and I really loved what I created. Each piece had a special significance to me. I could remember where I was when I made it; what I learned and how I grew while making that piece; how it felt to me, what I was trying to convey.
After about twenty drawings, my friend Jane pointed out to me something that I hadn't noticed myself yet—each of the pieces signaled something about me, what I like and find beautiful, and what I am trying to express with my heart and my soul and my life.
I realized that the same themes, ideas, and feelings were trying to express themselves, albeit in a new-to-me medium—and that they were coming out differently in that medium, impacting me and whoever saw my art in a slightly different way. Perhaps the things I felt I came here to share could be better expressed to some people, or in some ways, through visual art.
And over time, my drawings got better and better. Gradually, I learned new skills. Basic color theory. Various ways of making lines. Using the construction method to break complex scenes into basic shapes. Drawing in perspective using vanishing points.
There have been many boons from drawing, from gaining competency in making visual art. First off, it's fun. I really, really enjoy making art. I enjoy it more with each passing year! There's something about drawing that reliably takes me out of my head and into a flow state in a way that nothing else quite does. I reach for making visual art when I am awake and want to do something fun and creative but am brain dead and can't words too good.
I love making art for people and giving it to them as a gift. It's free for me to give, and if I pick the right subject and draw it well, it will really touch someone's heart.
I love illustrating my own writing. I write extensively, and making my own art helps get my ideas across in a clearer, more persuasive, and compelling way. It's also cool to run events or make other kinds of service projects and be able to use original art of my own making. It makes them feel unique, distinctive, compelling. Take these pieces of art, for example, which I made for mettā dance parties that I ran in Washington, D.C. and New York:
  

	  

	Each year since starting to draw, I've done “Inktober,” a month-long challenge where U try to make at least one drawing every day for the month of October. A lot of people follow a pre-made list of suggestions for what to draw, but I like to follow my heart and feel into what I want to draw each day. As I write these paragraphs, this is my fourth year in a row doing Inktober.
I see how the effort I've made over the last years has added up over time. Regularly drawing, watching tutorials, taking courses, and just continually showing up has made me a better visual artist with every passing year. I'm never going to be Van Gogh, or even Sílvia—but I will be Tasshin. I will be able to make art that nobody else could make, that expresses my heart.
My progress in skill at visual art has given me hope. I see what it's made possible for me, and given me faith that I could apply the same diligence over time to other mediums, even ones that feel quite difficult for me to do.
When I started working on music production earlier this year, I could see following a similar path for years. Keeping it fun. Putting in an initial focus period of several months to learn the most basic skills and tools. Maintaining those skills over time. Combining them with other skills (like making the visual art for the sets or tracks I make!)
Earlier this year, I was flying from Santa Barbara to Arizona, when I sat next to a young man on the plane. He had a lot of anime on his clothes, and various anime stickers on his laptop. I struck up a conversation—“So U like to draw?” 
He blushed, and said no, not at all. He told me that his girlfriend was a visual artist, but that he was hopeless at drawing.
This made me sad. I wanted to see if we could do something about it. I took out my notebook, tore out a piece of paper, and gave it to him along with one of my pens. I said, “follow me—just do exactly as I do.”
I drew a straight line; a circle; a triangle; S- and C-curves; a star and a heart; some scribbly lines, and a few other basic building blocks I’d learned over the years. At the end, I wrote “I can draw!” with a smiley face and had him write and draw that, too—a spell of sorts to help him believe he could draw, that he could be an artist. 
  

Then I suggested he draw a house made of the elements we’d drawn already. And lo and behold, he’d drawn a house! He was an artist!
I gave him a spare notebook I had, some pens. I wrote down my email address, and sent it to him. I hope one day he writes to me, and shows me the beautiful, expressive art that he’s made over the years.




________________
Learning Plans
When U are interested in learning more about a topic, it’s useful to develop a learning plan. Learning plans are closely related to skill trees, but are more personal: what is it that U want to learn, and why? How will U do it?


Developing a learning plan can be pretty informal. When I know I want to take on learning about a topic, or cultivating a skill, I like to have a conversation with a close trusted friend—perhaps someone who’s knowledgeable about the topic, or simply a friend invested in my learning and growth.


I’ll share my intentions about what I want to learn, and why. I’ll share my initial thoughts about how I’m going to learn that material, as well as any concerns I have or obstacles I foresee. Usually, talking about these challenges makes them more tractable—something I might get stuck on by myself for months or years can be resolved in a much shorter time.


For example, a couple of years ago, I wanted to learn about DJing and music production. I had already been running mettā dance parties—dance parties where U practice loving-kindness meditation—but I had some challenges. For one, I was using Spotify playlists for the dance parties, which limited my ability to make transitions between songs. They didn’t sound very good. 


Moreover, I was limited to existing tracks, or in a few cases, tracks I worked on with friends who were music producers. There were specific sounds and themes I was enamored of but were difficult to find the right combination of for my dance parties. I felt that learning to make music myself would be fun and help me to share more of the sounds I wanted with the world. 


That said, I knew it would be difficult. I’d had some musical training in the past—primarily vocal training—but DJ’ing and music production were whole new skill sets for me. 


I asked some close friends to help me get started by having a Zoom meeting together. Brent Baumgartner was skilled in music production. Eric Chisholm was the Curiosity Lead for The Service Guild at the time, and Zev Benjamin was the Love Lead.


I shared what I wanted to learn, and why. I shared my concerns—that I felt overwhelmed by all of the buttons and knobs on DJ boards, and by music production programs like Ableton Live. We talked about different avenues of exploration, and agreed that it would be easier to explore DJ’ing first and then music production later. We made a list of possible experiments I could run to make these things less overwhelming, including the short, sweet, actionable task of simply watching YouTube videos about how DJ boards worked.


I spent the first half of 2023 learning the basics of DJing, with a Traktor board and software. I then debuted my newfound skills at Vibecamp 2, with a group of 100-150 friends. My favorite moment was using a track I love—“Snoop Dawk” by Luttrell—with a Rob Burbea sample. Many of the people in the audience had heard and loved Rob Burbea. The crowd went wild when that sample played, and Luttrell’s drop hit. Honestly, working for several months on learning a complicated skill and then seeing people enjoy the fruits of my learning and work so much was pretty fucking satisfying—one of the happiest and most memorable and satisying moments of my life.


That learning meeting Brent, Eric, and Zev and I had set me up for success with beginning to learn DJ’ing—something that felt scary at the beginning, but became more and more tractable. And, as of this writing, I’ve spent several months in the first half of 2024 working on learning music production. At this point, I feel comfortable in Ableton Live and can make basic tracks that sound good to me!


Having a clear intention and plan has made it possible for me to gradually work towards my own learning goals. I have the foundations of the basics of DJ’ing and now music production and can keep developing my skills in these areas over time.


As Eisenhower said, “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” U don’t have to stick to the learning plan U made. Things will change. Things U thought U were interested in will become less interesting, while things U didn’t even know U were interested in will become more compelling. New opportunities and avenues for learning will become available. But the intentions U set will get U started, and shape how U approach things.

Ideas
  



Have U ever used a torrenting program? Oh, U have? For totally legal purposes, I assume.


A torrenting program is kind of cool because functionally, it breaks a file or set of files into lots of little chunks and sends them in a nonlinear but highly optimal order for downloading a file as fast as possible, given who is “seeding” or sharing the file. A lot of torrent apps include a visual display of which packets or sections of the files U are downloading have been downloaded, which looks like this:
  



Sometimes, I find that ideas arise in my mind kind of like this. A phrase occurs to me that makes no sense but draws my interest—or I’m suddenly curious about whether or not there are multiverses, but I can’t see yet how it relates to anything else I’m interested in.


I’ve learned to trust these intuitions—that even if ideas arise out of a seemingly logical order, to believe that there’s a deeper logic to my intuition or subconscious. Ideas are like files or packages downloaded in pieces—packets arriving out of logical order, offered generously and expediently in order of conception.


Twitter (X) is very helpful for respecting the ideas that come to U. At its best, tweeting can feel like torrenting your own ideas across time: “i’m not sure what this shitpost or random thought is doing here but idk it feels good bro just hit post, i'll understand why later tyvm.”


If an idea arises in your mind, no matter how nonsensical or random or silly or useless or banal it may seem now, it may have some value U have not yet conceived of, which will occur only far later, when put in combination with new ideas or a larger context U don't yet have.


There's a lot of power in simply acknowledging, listening to, and writing down the phrases U hear in your head. U don't have to endorse them or believe them just because U heard them. In my experience, they have some kind of wisdom and perspective to share, no matter the words or tone or energy they come with. 


If U take the time to listen to the ideas that come to U, to write them down, and then to act on them—more and more ideas will come to U, and those will have larger and larger impacts on your life, and the world.


Typically, when I find myself articulating the same ideas multiple times over years, those ideas evolve in several predictable ways.


First and foremost, the ideas become simpler. I clarify what is essential, and set aside what is not. I hone in on that core heart of the idea, and articulate that.


It becomes clearer, as well. I understand better how to explain the idea to someone who it's new for—what their current perspective is, and what pieces of information will bring them over into my perspective, will make the ideas I want to share with them available.


This often involves a kind of sequencing or logical ordering. Knowing the dependency tree of ideas, what needs to be explained or connected first, before later ideas can be introduced or offered.


The way I articulate an idea also becomes more persuasive over time. I am attuned to what people respond to, what resonates for them, what is enlivening and generative for others—which related metaphors or stories bring the ideas to life. Then I double down on those[b].




be a student of inspiration, attend carefully to the causality of what inspires you, notice it, remember it, be moved by it, create based on it, thank those who inspired U when U can, and above all open Urself ever more deeply to further inspiration




________________
Attention
I’ve done a lot of meditation in my day. And a lot of that meditation was about training my attention, cultivating my concentration capacity.


Honestly, a lot of that time I spent meditating was difficult and unpleasant. I still remember sitting each day on an uncomfortable chair in my college dorm, trying to follow my breath, feeling frustrated with myself because I had such a hard time with it. I’d get so fidgety, and just wish I could get the heck out of there. And somehow, I managed to do that every day for years, just because I thought it was probably good for me.


Unfortunately, it took me a very long time to learn a very simple fact about paying attention that might have made it more enjoyable: the secret ingredient to stable attention is enjoyment.


If U are paying attention to something U enjoy, or finding some way to enjoy the experience of paying attention, it’s much, much, much easier to pay attention.


I can fastidiously pay attention to the most interesting thing in my experience for hours on end. I can listen to and converse with someone attentively for literally hours on end—say four or six or even more—if it's sufficiently interesting. If it’s boring, sometimes I can't be bothered to pay attention for six minutes.










________________
Stances
In August of 2021, I had a podcast conversation with my friend Eric Chisholm, diving deeper into his approach to learning, especially in relation to movement practices. Eric shared the approach that had helped him to become an expert in West Coast Swing, so that I could start to use these methods in my Tai Chi practice and other movement-based learning interests.


In this conversation, Eric introduced me to the idea of a stance. Eric calls it an approach to “learning where you're doing habit surgery via mindfulness and nudging.” Here’s how I would describe what he shared with me: having a stance is holding an intention towards what U are doing or learning. U are doing the exact same activity as U would otherwise—doing a dance swing, practicing a Tai Chi section, having a conversation, or folding the laundry—but with a specific intention. 


You sustain this intention throughout the activity, as a way to practice a specific sub-skill or explore a new aspect of that activity. Not only does using stances help U learn effectively, but it also helps to make the learning process a fun, exploratory adventure—almost like you’re playing a game.


Importantly, U are the one holding the stance. A teacher or coach can suggest a specific stance for U to work on—and good teachers will—but U are the one holding the stance. A teacher can't hold the stance for U. A teacher can't care about what U are learning for U. A teacher can't practice or learn for U. U do the learning, U do the practice; U hold the stance.


Ideally, U become the kind of learner who sets and holds your own stances, who isn’t dependent on a teacher to learn or grow. This is especially important because U may wish to learn about realms of life for which there are no teachers or credible experts, no textbooks or established practices. Despite the absence of a clear and established context, U can learn about them anyway, and stances are useful here, too.


Stances can be applied to any context. U can apply it to a legible learning activity (like mastering rock climbing), or U can apply it to a nebulous and unique learning situation (like how to maintain neighborly relationships on your street, with your specific neighbors).


Stances can be held for a short time (a minute or an hour), or for a long time (weeks or months or even years). 


You don’t necessarily need to be able to articulate a stance in words. Doing so can be very helpful for the learning process, but it’s not necessary. Some stances U may wish to hold will be somewhat nebulous, often when U first start exploring them. If your intuition says a stance would be valuable, interesting, or even just plain fun to try on, go for it—even if U can’t explain it to someone else, or justify it to a teacher or coach.


Here are some examples specific stances I’ve held, selected from a variety of contexts:
* Tai Chi: Practice each section of the form twice as slow as I would otherwise be inclined to. 
* Interpersonal Relationships: Say the direct, challenging, uncomfortable thing in conversations as a way to lean into necessary, useful conflict rather than avoiding it.
* Podcast Interviews: Ask any unusual or surprising questions that arise spontaneously in my mind. Trust my intuition.


Learning and using the meta-skill of stances is something that can help U in a wide variety of contexts and learning goals. They’re fun to use, and will help U learn more effectively.

Learning Journey: Fiction
When I was in high school, I wanted to write the Great American Novel. In my literature class I’d fallen in love with the way Twain and Fitzgerald, Steinbeck and Salinger moved my heart. I’d always loved reading fiction, and the idea of writing my novel myself captivated my imagination and my ambition. In retrospect, it wasn’t so much that I wanted to write the Great American Novel, as that I wanted to write a novel, and I wanted it to be excellent.


Over time, this ambition faded. I developed an interest in philosophy and mysticism, and through that, started a meditation practice and eventually began monastic training. While I still loved fiction, it looked less and less like the direction I wanted to go in. I was interested in Living the Best Life, in discovering and living the truth. I wanted the Right Answers.


In monastic training, I didn’t read nearly as many novels as I used to. I also began to feel guilty about my interest in watching movies, my other great fictional love. There was a period of my life where I watched one or more movies every day, and I began to see my love of films as addictive, obsessive. Eventually, I decided to make a commitment to never watch another movie again. “I’ve seen enough movies for one lifetime,” I thought to myself. “I have better things to do with my time”—like meditating and getting enlightened.


Later, my friend River helped me to see that narratives, myths, and stories were more like an essential spiritual food group for me. Fiction serves so many purposes that I couldn’t see from the perspective of “There is a Best Life” and “There is a Right Answer” and “There are Right and Wrong Ways to Spend your Time.” 


For starters, fiction—whether it’s novels or movies or TV shows or graphic novels—is not only joyful, but it helps you to understand urself and other people better, to fuel the imagination and consider what it’s like to be someone else in a different world. It can be morally instructive, giving you heroes with virtues to admire and villains with vices and mistakes to avoid.


It helps you to notice what you are called towards, to get in touch with your soul’s deep desires and inclinations—and gives you the inspiration to pursue those desires in your own life. But again, it’s also joyful—it’s fun, live-giving—something that is an end in itself. I realized that it was okay to have fun with my life!


If fiction, story, and narrative were an essential food group, I was starving myself by abstaining from movies. After leaving monastic training, I decided to break my commitment, and began watching movies again. One lesson I learned from that arc: avoid ill-advised, broad-strokes long-term commitments. As a rule of thumb, time-bound commitments are much better. Trying something for a day, a week, a month or a year gives you a natural length of time to try something and see what happens. Then you can pause, consider what happened, what you learned, and what you want to do next.


Paradoxically, I actually trust my own integrity more now, because I’m more wary of making open-ended long-term commitments, and more willing to make time-bound commitments as experiments.


Then, in the fall of 2022, I had my friend Anansi on my podcast. Part of the reason I regularly have conversations is to discuss what really matters, to raise questions that truly burn, to weigh answers and solutions, to get inspired—to let a conversation steer your course and change your life. Unsurprisingly, that conversation was just such a life-changing conversation. One big part of that was when Anansi mentioned his own time doing NaNoWriMo. 


NaNoWriMo is National Novel Writing Month. In November, writers around the world plan to write a novel within the span of a month. By default, participants aim to write an average of 1,667 words per day in order to write a 50,000 word novel within the month. I’d done Inktober (a similar challenge for visual artists) for the previous two years, had found it incredibly fruitful, and was excited by the idea of trying NaNoWrimo.


My conversation with Anansi reminded me of my long-lost, dormant ambitions to write fiction. It felt like a clear signal from the universe that it was time to return to those dreams. So, that November, I embarked on the journey. I ended up writing Theodicy, a short, 10,000 word, thirty page novella. 


I’m very proud of the final work, but while I was writing it, the process was tremendously difficult. On the one hand, it was quite simple. I did very little planning—I had a few clear images I wanted to work with, and I simply typed what came to mind, stream-of-consciousness style. I had enough skill as a writer and clarity about the content to write something significant and compelling.


On the other hand, I had a tremendous amount of negative self-talk as I found myself typing the words that entered my mind and heart. “This novel is so weird.” “No one has ever written anything like this before.” “No one is ever going to like this.” “No one is going to read it.” “People are going to think you are so weird.”


All of that self-talk really surprised me, because I don’t usually experience negative self-talk. Doing many hours of meditation practice, monastic training, therapy and self-therapy techniques, and other experiments largely diminished my negative self-talk. At some point, I gradually learned that negative self-talk is not only unkind to myself—it just isn’t that helpful. 
But during the process of writing this novel, the negative self-talk came back with a vengeance. 


As I understand it, that negative self-talk was associated with younger, less mature parts of myself—the parts of myself that wanted to write the Great American Novel when I was 17 or 18—the parts of me that had ambitions to write fiction. I’d set those parts of myself aside for years while I studied philosophy, traveled the world, and trained in a monastery. I had largely moved on from negative self-talk, but my younger parts that were interested in things like writing fiction hadn’t. Now that I was coming back to them, they were telling me that I was a piece of crap, that no one would ever like me or my novels, that I'd never be any good, let alone Great. 


Part of the process of writing that novel that month was rehabilitating my long-lost, forgotten ambitions. Coming to terms with what I’d once dreamed of, acknowledging that I’d abandoned them. Dusting off the parts of those dreams that still felt compelling and relevant, and setting aside the parts that no longer spoke to me. Living and writing from the place of inspiration and clarity that emerged.


it's possible to rehabilitate your relationship to your forgotten, abandoned dreams


I realized that some of my heroes who wrote novels, like Cervantes or Joyce or Woolf, probably went through similar emotions when they wrote their stories. Their stories were weird, too; the world had never seen anything quite like what they’d written until they did. I’m not saying Theodicy is on the caliber of Don Quixote or The Waves, but this thought helped me to honor the fear of my own weirdness that surfaced through my writing.


When I write what I call an informational blog post—a non-fiction essay about a specific topic I’m interested in—it’s easy to hide behind the topic, without really showing myself. But there’s no hiding in fiction. Every story bares the heart and soul of the author, their hopes and dreams and fears and habits and mistakes all laid out for the whole world to see if only they look. And Theodicy was doing exactly that—the characters were very explicitly, obviously parts of myself.


Although writing Theodicy was challenging internally, I love what I wrote. And more importantly, I healed the younger parts of myself that had ambitions I’d set aside for so long. Having come back into contact with them, and honored what their dreams were from a new moment and vantage point in my life, I felt newly capable of writing fiction again.


As of this writing, I’ve written four novellas: Theodicy (2022), It Wasn’t (2023), Avec paix dans mon coeur (2024), and A Portrait of the Escort as a Young Woman (2024). While some themes overlap between them, they are very different novels. With each successive project, I’ve tackled new territory and specific technical skills, like worldbuilding, character design, planning the plot. 


These are stances. A specific novel or fiction project provides a perfect scope to explore a specific stance or intention in a time-bound way, to develop specific skills or capacities. Here’s what I wrote down for my stance for my current fiction project, a short story:


I want to write a short story specifically as a skill-building exercise, that pushes two growth edges in my capacities as a fiction author:
* Plotting: Grow my capacity to plan and plot a story, following a structure. Use the Save the Cat template for beats of the narrative to familiarize myself with those beats. Learn the rules to break them.
* Showing, Not Telling: Tell myself the story first and foremost, then work out how to show each element and detail. Ensure the drafts and final copy have 100% showing, not telling. Cultivate the capacity for vivid, cinematic demonstration of the characters and narrative.


As part of my ongoing explorations into writing fiction, I am try to regularly enjoy fiction, reading novels and watching movies and TV shows that interest me. As I do, I’m trying to understand what works and what resonates, and what doesn’t. In many ways, considering the meta of how a particular story is crafted has become more enjoyable than immersing myself in the plot.


Even as I seek out novels to read and movies to watch, I yearn for something different than anything I’ve found. There’s an itch I long to scratch that nothing I’ve seen quite does it for me. Certain stories I deeply resonate with get close, or scratch aspects of this itch. But they don’t cover the whole of it, and the average bestseller or Hollywood movie doesn’t even come close, no matter how well written or highly produced it is.


That’s the reason to write my own stories: to create the tales that scratch the itch that no one else knows how to scratch for me. Hell, just to find the itch and try my best.


My novels definitely begin to scratch that itch. I’ve re-read each of them multiple times since I wrote them, because in many ways they come closer to scratching that itch than anything I’ve read. And also: they’re not good enough, there’s more to go, the itch is still scratchy, and I can get far better at scratching it.


We’ll see how it works out, but I’d like to keep writing novels, perhaps one a year. I imagine that if I keep writing a novel a year, and I do that for ten or twenty years—even writing some bad or just decent novels—I’ll be able to write a novel magnificent enough to truly impress my younger teenage self, the one that longed to write the Great American Novel. If I’m honest with myself, I would still really like that! And who knows, I could even end up writing or directing a film, something else I would love. But as long as I enjoy the process and have fun along the way, it’s all good, no matter what I end up creating or how good or not good anyone thinks it is—including myself.


U may or may not want to write fiction. The point of this essay isn’t really about me, or a particular novel I wrote, or a dream I have to write one some day in the future. It’s about all of us. It’s about listening closely to the whispers of your soul, the dreams you find urself dreaming. It’s about honoring those callings, even as they change, and you change, and the whole world changes. There is a truth and a purpose behind each calling, each dream we have laden in our soul. If we follow it where it leads in each chapter of our life, we will undoubtedly be surprised by what comes.


if u have aspirations in your heart, you have to try and fail, u have to be okay with making mistakes and falling down and even failing—and u also have to make peace with the possibility of succeeding above and beyond your wildest dreams

Learning Journey: Chess
At different points of my life, I’ve been obsessed with chess. It’s a recurring obsession, that comes and goes. I was obsessed with chess as a kid. 


I remember looking lovingly at a stray white plastic knight that my Dad had in his stereo room, yearning to learn the rules of the game so I could play. Chess evoked a gestalt of fantasy and power, strategy and skill that captivated me, drew me in.


I persuaded my Dad to teach me. In the early days, I liked to establish perfectly symmetrical openings, that looked beautiful—and were totally vulnerable to being defeated. At first my Dad beat me. I checked out huge piles of chess books from the library. I remember especially enjoying Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess, which was accessible to all levels but went into some depth, respected the reader’s skill and potential. 


(There’s a great story about Bobby Fischer from Frank Brady’s biography of him, about him playing chess on a portable board in school, before he dropped out. When his teacher caught him, and called him on it, he put the chess board away—but it was obvious to everyone from his demeanor that he was still playing in his head.)


After some practice and study, I began to beat my Dad. He would get frustrated easily and it was less fun to play him, not because I was better, but because it became emotional. I just wanted to play.


My parents took me to chess clubs and chess camps. I bought books and software and DVD’s over the years to learn as much as my could. One of my favorite memories of my Mom is our trip to New York City, the chess capital of America, if not the world. She planned a trip for us. We drove to Connecticut, took the Amtrak train into the city, and spent the weekend traveling to different chess book stores around the city, where she bought me more chess books than I could possibly read, and George Washington Square park, where I watched blitz played in person.


  



I remember one summer in middle school, making grand plans to study chess for hours each day. My energy and motivation lasted for several days before hitting a wall. I didn’t have the words for it then, but I just wasn’t having fun. That was perhaps my first encounter with the mind body split, with top-down plans being “foiled” by bottom-up realities. No matter how much I read about my chess heroes that put hours and hours into studying chess day after day for years, I knew I just didn’t have it in me to do that. 


My interest in chess has come and gone many times over the years. At St. John’s, it was revived when I learned that one of my best friends was also interested in chess. We played chess online before we even enrolled, having met through a Facebook group for incoming Johnnies. It was an easy way for me to bond with others, to overcome an uneven and awkward set of social skills. As those grew, my chess interest faded.


In my mid twenties, when I took a year away from MAPLE, my chess obsession was revived. My ex’s Dad was obsessed with the Stonewall Defense opening, and he taught me the basics. It’s not a familiar opening to most people, and if you know how to play it well, it establishes a very strong foundation for white early on, and opens up some interesting traps. For a time, the Stonewall Defense became my special interest. I played game after game of blitz online, disappointed when I had to play black and couldn’t play the Stonewall.


I think I reached for chess in those years when I was lonely, when I wanted some stimulation and sense of joy on demand. I often say that I’m good enough at chess to know that I’m not very good. In a similar way, for me, chess is a reliable source of some happiness, albeit not very much. In saner chapters, I would set chess aside, and get immersed in friendships, projects, and other learning endeavors. 


Recently, two of my dear friends invited me to go a bar to meet with a group of their friends. I wasn’t sure why, but my intuition told me to go there. 


At the bar, I noticed there was a chess board, and I wanted to play. For some reason, I wanted to ask a specific person to play. I'd met him briefly a year prior, but didn’t know him very well. When I asked him to play, he was delighted, and said yes. It turned out he’d spent the winter recovering from an injury and playing chess in bed, using his convalescence to learn to play well.


We met up again a few days later. As we played, we talked about chess, about our respective skills and challenges. Based on what we’d discussed, I challenged him to consider at least two candidate moves for each move, to weigh them to see which he thought was stronger.


Our conversation got me thinking about my own game, also. I’d noticed that there's usually at least one or two or more moments per game where I might blunder very easily, if I don't stop to think. So I tried playing with an awareness of these moments. 


Initially, my stance was something like, notice when it's one of those decisive moments and play better then. Then I refined it to: play intuitively when I can; notice decisive moments and calculate then—just like I was asking my friend to calculate. Then I realized that those are right and left-brain hemispheres respectively, which I’ve noticed in other contexts and domains, and found useful to relate to.


Then I got curious about how I know when it's one of those decisive moments. So I kept playing with that same stance in terms of chess, but I switched stances with respect to my awareness, my consciousness—to something like: investigate how I know when it's one of those decisive moments. What exactly am I aware of that makes me think, “Gee, I could blunder if i'm not careful here”?


I realized that when I am in one of those decisive moments, I have an intuitive sense of what move to play, and I don't trust that intuitive move. It turns out that I always have an intuitive guess as to what move to play, and I always have an additional sense of whether I can trust that intuition, or not.


In moments where I'm trusting my intuition, playing decisively, playing quickly—I am confident, there is a feeling of security and strength in my body, of trust in my intuition and my read of the board. But in moments where I distrust my intuition, where I have a guess as to what to play but am wary of it, there's a feeling of fear in my body, of unsafety, of uncertainty, of threat, of confusion, of complexity. And typically on the board there's a lot of complexity, unfamiliar territory.


In those games, I also practiced calculating for the first time in a long time. I figured that if I was encouraging my friend to do so, I should do the same: really reasoning through the different options. Talking to myself about the different variables. Selecting 3-4 different candidate moves, visualizing what they would look like, the lines that could follow. 


I realized that I'd stopped calculating in the past because it felt boring and un-fun to do that for every move. But it turns out it's a lot more fun to calculate when my intuition says that would be a very good idea, when the position calls for it. 


At some point, I realized that I was talking aloud. That was fine for the game I was playing with my friend, who was enjoying it—and because I didn’t particularly care if I won or lost—but that in a "real game" it would be good to be able to talk to myself about the game, to have my metacognitive awareness process and my cognitive chess process be internalized. 


So that would be my ideal stance for the next game, to do the same thing I did the other day—playing intuitively when I sense that is the move, pausing to reason and consider when I sense that is called for—but discussing the game in my own head, not showing my cards by talking aloud. 


That game was the most fun I’d had playing chess in a long time. Usually, chess is fun, but it's like a local minimum fun, a lazy fun. I'm not interested in putting in the work to get better at the game for its own sake. I’ve long sympathized with Morphy’s bitter mot, “The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life.”


Still, I discovered something that day. Chess may no longer be very interesting to me in and of itself. I no longer dream of becoming a famous grandmaster. But my competence at chess, and my competence at awareness practices and introspection, make for an excellent combination. Chess can be a kind of mirror for my own mind, a territory for exploring my awareness, metacognition, introspection, embodiment, and intuition. Doing so makes playing chess much more fun and interesting, valuable and wholesome. Moreover, I'm pretty sure the insights I glean will not be limited to just playing chess, but will generalize to other relevant situations.

Sharing What U Learn
Sharing what U learn is what makes your curiosity something that is of benefit to the world—a service project. Sharing what U have learned in your travels and journeys is a kindness to those learners to come, a service to the world at large, and ripe soil for ever more curiosity, learning, growth for all.


My gold standard for my informational blog posts and other, similar writing is “write the piece I wish I'd had/read when I started being interested in the topic.” That’s why it makes me so, so happy to hear when people find my writing useful... because they had the gift of reading the thing I wished I'd had when I started.


U are building a library of perspectives, frame shifts, ideas, words and phrases, exercises to help people. As U build the library, it will grow, as will your understanding. As U build the library, more and more people will benefit.


It can be hard to anticipate in advance the possible benefits sharing your ideas and projects with the world will have, for U and the people they reach. Share what U can and let Urself be surprised by the magic and miracles that come.


Please, please, please trust your desire to create the things U wish U'd had—it is precisely the thing the world needs most from U.

Words
If U write enough, journal entries and tweets and essays and books, eventually U’ll encounter things U want to say that U don't have words for, regions of the territory for which there is no map, or the maps are not so good.


I try to pay close attention to the things I find difficult to express in words, because it's precisely there that something new and important wants to be expressed. And that is when and where we reach for inventing words.


My friend River made a glossary, and shared this:
Words, amirite? Well-chosen ones can reshape reality. They can make hopelessly complex ideas intuitively simple — or make simple ideas look like a complicated jungle of knots and swampland.


Me, my curse is that I both A) think that using simple, common words wherever possible is the royal road to clarity and rapport with the reader, and B) I make up new terms and re-define old ones in non-obvious ways. I can't help myself. One of the most common bits of feedback I get is "I love what you're saying! I don't like, understand what U mean half the time, but when I do it's great!"


Lately, I've been working on writing more simply, using words in more widely-understood ways.


But today, I'm giving myself a jubilee — I'm gonna write down all the neologisms and portmanteaus and re-defined terms and nomenclature drawn from obscure literary forms and I'm just going to lean into using language as a paintball machine gun to splatter all y'all with meaning and evocation, and that's just how it's gonna be; so let's get to it.


He proceeded to edify us about terms like “Autochthony” and “Tilism.”


River’s glossary inspired me to make my own, too. Some of the words are bog-standard English words I’m using in specific or unconventional ways (“love” or “empowerment”). Others are words I made up (“funprofessional” and “you-shaped”).


If U start making your own words, eventually U will encounter—whether within Urself, or from another person—the issue of Linguistic prescription, or the classic feud between Prescriptivists and Descriptivists.


I was a Prescriptivist when I was younger. I believed that language had rules, there were correct and incorrect usages of words and grammar, and a given sentence was either Right or Wrong. 


A Descriptivist, on the other hand, looks at how language is actually used. A Descriptivist believes that language is a living, evolving entity, and that the "rules" of language should reflect how it is actually used by speakers, rather than prescribing how it "should" be used. 


Descriptivism isn't merely a philosophy about language and words. it's an invitation to a radical form of direct action. U can decide which words U use and which words U don't—including made-up words or even made-up, irregular weird grammatical constructions. 


Give Urself the power to use words (or not use words) as U like, for the highest joy and benefit. U’ll have way more fun doing it. Descriptivism is way more fun than prescriptivism.


Words are so fucking fun to play with. Unreasonably fun. Endlessly fun. 


U can make your own words up. U can find and make your own vocabulary. U can invent new words by just combining them together, tongue-fusing existent-words together. 


More words please—more wordplay, more verbal dancing and sparring and adventuring. 


U need to be vocabmaxxing. U need to be circling new words U find in books with a pen, highlighting them on your Kindle. U need to be using your new words in sentences and adding them to Anki.


U need to find daily the satisfaction of knowing the perfect one hundred dollar word for a situation, and choosing whether to use it or its ten dollar cousin.


U need to be making DFW sweat in his grave with your raw literary power. U need to be dictionarymaxxing and thesaurusmaxxing. U need to be etymology-literate and seven-languages-conversant. U need to be making up more words. U need to be coming right up against the very limits of human language.

Managing Learning Flow
As a young reader, I would always read one book at a time. I would start a book, and keep reading it until I had finished it. Very rarely, I would decide to stop reading a book before I had finished it.


I started reading multiple books in parallel while studying at St. John’s College, my alma mater and a Great Books school, where almost all of the school work involves reading books. Reading in parallel dramatically increased the number of books I was able to read in a given time period. I found myself reading at least 100 books a year (including my own personal reading). By reading multiple books at the same time, I was able to discover more quickly if I didn’t want to finish a book, and switch to a new book. Or if I simply needed a break from one book, I could move to another before coming back to the first with fresh eyes. Most importantly, I found myself enjoying reading (even) more, which resulted in me reading more. Since graduating, I’ve maintained the habit of reading in parallel.


Of course, sheer quantity isn’t everything. What U read matters too, and even if you’re reading excellent books, it’s easy to misunderstand them without careful study. 


Reading multiple books at the same time also improved the quality of my reading. The program of study at St. John’s is carefully designed. One of the intentions is to juxtapose similar authors and topics at the same time in ways that facilitate understanding. 


Partially, this is chronological: for example, U read the Torah before proceeding to read the New Testament and then various Christian theological writers. But U also read across topics in meaningful ways. For example, for my mathematics class, I studied Leibniz’ discovery of calculus at the same time that I was reading his metaphysical works in the main seminar class. This all affords a kind of reading which Mortimer Adler, author of How to Read A Book, calls syntopical reading, or comparative reading, which aims at a broad, synthetic view of a topic across authors, books, and cultures.


Like most college students, I was also required to write multiple essays at the same time. I was also a prolific writer. One professor said that she would ask for 5 pages and I would hand in 10; that she would ask for one essay and get two. In the same way as with reading, I discovered that writing multiple essays at the same time made it easier to increase the overall quantity and quality of my writing.


After graduating from St. John’s, I took two courses that changed how I go about reading and writing. Tiago Forte’s Building a Second Brain and David Perell’s Write of Passage. Both of these courses borrow key insights from the Theory of Constraints (TOC) and Lean/Just-in-Time Manufacturing. In TOC, small batch sizes, processed in parallel, paradoxically improves the quantity and quality of throughput. This is an extremely counterintuitive finding in manufacturing, the original testbed for TOC, and in some ways it is no less surprising in knowledge work. The courses gave me a system for reliably producing interesting ideas, and for distributing those in writing. 


By implementing these systems, I discovered something I didn’t expect: reading multiple books at the same time, or writing multiple essays at the same time, increases not only the quantity of books I read, but also the quality of the essays I write.


However, I discovered a new problem. I had more blog post ideas than I could possibly write. I had a hard time deciding which ones to work on, and began collecting a large number of half-finished drafts of blog posts. Similarly, swimming in an abundance of reading options, I started new books more often than I finished them.


Both problems had a similar flavor: flow problems. How could I be sure I wasn’t abusing massive parallelism, and aimlessly multi-tasking? How could I prioritize what’s most important to focus on?


I found a solution in two key insights from TOC and JIT Manufacturing: making work visible, and implementing work-in-progress (WIP) limits. Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry's book Personal Kanban was especially helpful. It describes how to use the Kanban system tracking items that are important to you, like tasks, appointments, and small projects. The Two Rules of Personal Kanban are to 1) visualize your work and 2) limit your work-in-progress (WIP).
You visualize your work by using a physical or digital board where U can create columns to represent different stages of your workflow. I like to use Notion, but another tool or a physical whiteboard would work just as well. U might have columns for "To-Do," "In Progress," and "Done." By moving tasks or activities across these columns, U can easily see the progress you're making and identify any bottlenecks or areas where U might need to adjust your focus.
You limit your work-in-progress with WIP Limits by setting a maximum number of tasks or activities that U can have in progress at any given time. This helps to prevent overwhelm and ensures that U can focus on completing tasks before starting new ones.
These days, my learning input and output have expanded from just reading and writing to include online courses, podcast conversations, and vlogs. I use kanban boards and WIP limits to manage my learning throughput with all of these modes.
Every two weeks, I have a conversation with my friend Abi (also in the Curiosity Department) where we review our respective input and output. I consult these dashboards for my portion of our conversations. We’ve been doing these biweekly check-ins for nearly three years now, and it’s helped me to stay on track with both learning what I’m curious about, and sharing what I’ve found with the world.
Reading
I currently break my reading process down into five stages in my kanban board:
1. Not Started
2. Reading
3. Processing Notes
4. Done
5. Not Reading (decided to stop reading, for the time being or permanently)


My current WIP Limits for reading are 4 books in progress. 


In the ideal case, at least one of these is an audio book, at least one is a digital book, and at least one is a physical book. I find different mediums easier to read in different circumstances, and different kinds of books more suitable for reading in different mediums. Having a variety of different mediums available makes it easier to read in more situations.
Online Courses
I currently break my process for taking online courses into four stages in my kanban board: Not started, In progress, Done, and Unfinished.


I’ve found it useful to reflect on which themes of online courses I am drawn to taking, and to tag them accordingly. Currently, the tags I use are Art, Business, Leadership, Meditation, Music, Social Skills, Tech, and Writing.


I’m newer to tracking my online courses in this way, but as of this writing, my current WIP limit for online courses is two at a time.
Writing
When U drive a car, U don’t try to start the car, reverse, accelerate, turn, stop, and park all at the same time. That’d be madness.


Unfortunately, most people don’t recognize that writing is a generic term for a series of discrete phases. They share the same output—words, shared—but have very different mentalities. Research is not brainstorming is not drafting is not revising is not publishing. Discerning which stage you're in makes it easier to write, and get more work published, faster.


I currently break my writing process down into ten stages in my kanban board:
1. Idea
2. Gathering Notes / Theses / Questions
3. Outlining
4. Drafting
5. Soliciting Content Feedback
6. Revising
7. Soliciting Editing Feedback
8. Final Polishing
9. Publishing
10. Distributing


  

Going through each of these stages makes me feel far more confident about publishing my writing. I’ve thought about it, articulated my thoughts, gotten feedback on the content, revised, gotten editing feedback, and revised it further. Then it just…feels ready to publish! No one stage is too difficult or burdensome, and yet each successive stage increases the quality of each post.


My current WIP Limit is a maximum of four posts at a time being drafted or revised.
Podcast Conversations
I currently break my podcast process down into 9 stages in my kanban board:
1. Possible Guests
2. On Deck
3. Asking
4. Scheduling
5. Generating Questions
6. Recording
7. Editing
8. Done
9. Parking Lot


I don’t currently have a WIP limit for podcast conversations. Recording podcast conversations is bottlenecked on my travel schedule—on knowing ahead of time that I will be in a location with good internet, quiet space, and the privacy to record extended conversations. Often, when I know in advance that I will be in such a location for an extended period of time, I will schedule as many podcast conversations as possible during that time.
Vlogs
I like to record vlogs as a snapshot of my thinking about a particular topic. Often, I will reach to record a vlog when it’s clear that I have a number of thoughts about a topic, but I’m not ready to write about that topic yet, or certain that I even want to. Speaking verbally helps me to work out my own thinking in an exploratory way, without committing to writing anything about it. Recording my thoughts lets me share my thoughts with others, so that they might help them, or so that I might receive feedback. It also makes it easier to write about that topic, if later I want to return to a specific point I made, so as to use it as the basis of a section of an essay, for example.


I currently break my process for recording videos down into seven stages in my kanban board:
1. Ideas
2. On Deck
3. Recording
4. Editing
5. Publishing
6. Done
7. Parking Lot

Journaling
In 2020, I had a goal to journal more. I had a sense that more reflection would help me with my life goals and emotions.


In the past, the approach of "having one physical journal that's a nice notebook" or even "having one digital journal" hadn't stuck for me.


In the end, the thing that worked for me, personally, was to have as many possible journals as possible to journal in. A big physical journal, a small physical journal, and many many digital spaces: multiple note-taking apps, Twitter alts, Slack and Discord channels. 


Each place had pros and cons, but I could use whichever was easiest or best suited my purpose. I just used whichever whenever, in whatever ways felt good. 
  







Over time, I've converged on a pretty good suite of journals that work for me, mostly a variety of Discord feeds and crossposting to Twitter or other places. 


I will use physical journals when I feel like it, or that's more convenient. I don't have too much trouble remembering what's where. If it's digital, it's easy to search for, and if it’s physical, I usually remember what that felt like and where it is. 


Here’s how I would describe my journaling practice now: journal and reflect on what’s happening, all day long. Or, more playfully: journal 3x more than anyone thinks I do.


Journaling has become an integral part of my life and my work. Often, my journals form the basis of my writing—tweets, newsletters, blog posts and essays. It’s easy to recycle and adapt my reflections for public writing—sometimes as easy as literally copying and pasting excerpts of my journals from one text box to another. 


And on a personal level: there’s nothing quite like the feeling of having journaled to completion about all the things on my heart.


Putting what’s bothering me into words helps me to describe the problems I’m facing, so that I can solve them. And articulating what’s inspiring me, or has drawn my curiosity, makes it possible for me to go deeper down the rabbit hole.


When I think about what I write in my journals, I imagine some of it might sound insane, neurotic. And maybe I am. But in the end, I think I'm just another human—one who uses words to be honest and thorough, to articulate my inner world, my experiences, my motivations...


I think if anyone takes time and care to put their experience into words, or another medium of expression, the particularities of their individuality, their life and heart, will bleed through, show themselves in all their splendor and weirdness and oddities.


I really love journaling. Attending to the ups and downs of my heart, the ins and outs of my days, The major plot lines and the most significant minutiae makes me feel like my own very best friend.


(the practice is you just keep writing and writing until you break your own heart. that's the practice. that's the entire practice. you can dress it up in a lot of other words but that's the pith of it)

Correspondence
In college my grandmother and I exchanged at least one letter a month. I’d share about what I was studying or my friends, and she'd tell me about her life and ideas, and we got to know each other better as adults. I treasured connecting with her in that way, and still have the letters she wrote me.


I also had an extensive email correspondence at the time. A friend recently wrote me to resurface an email I wrote him in 2011:
  



I'd completely forgotten about this era, where I wrote extremely extra emails. Honestly, I could use more of this energy in my correspondence and my life.


When we traveled in Asia together after I graduated college, my friend Ulysse (then Ben) introduced me to a software program he'd written called Keep in Touch. The idea was to keep a list of people U wanted to stay in touch with, as well as information about when U’d last contacted them. I used it regularly for a few years after that and was able to maintain friendships and connections that otherwise might have gone by the wayside.


Peace Pilgrim is one of my greatest heroes. In addition to walking tens of thousands of miles spreading her message of peace, she also maintained an extensive correspondence. The editors of her book say that she “considered it part of her job to reply to all of the thousands of people who wrote to her over the years.” Her mail was one of the few things she carried with her on her pilgrimage, inside the pockets of her tunic. 


One of my friend Visa’s heroes is Erasmus, the 16th century Dutch humanist, theologian and philosopher. Visa describes Erasmus as “one of the most prolific men of letters in the 1500’s, corresponding with literally hundreds of people,” including Pope Adrian VI, Pope Leo X, Henry VIII. “Why did Erasmus correspond with hundreds of people?” Visa asks. “BECAUSE HE COULD!!!”


Visa describes his goal in life as “being the Erasmus and/or Mersenne of Nerd Twitter, and the broader (Friendly Ambitious) Nerd Internet.”


Erasmus, Mersenne, and Peace Pilgrim didn’t live in the time of the internet, but Visa, U, and I do. The internet makes it possible to correspond with anyone else with a connection—something like two thirds of the planet’s human population. 


For me, corresponding through text messages, voice mail, email etc. is load-bearing in my friendships, since I am not based anywhere, and all of my friendships are remote / long-distance most of the time.


Internet friendships are a novel form of connection historically speaking, but they’re very fulfilling for me personally! The friends that I’ve met online are so interesting to learn more about and enjoyable to spend time with! Having continued online contact gives me more context on who someone is and what they care about than I would otherwise be exposed to e.g. if I just met someone at a party or something like that.


It's also invaluable to me to correspond with people for “professional” reasons, too. My work in the world is intimately connected to having a large social graph and context about what a lot of different people are doing.


The capacity to correspond with friends, acquaintances, collaborators and peers affords all of us tremendous power.


Relationships can grow in depth, meaning, joy, and benefit over years and decades, and correspondence makes it possible to begin, maintain, and deepen a large number of relationships over time.


That said, pretty much everyone I know increasingly has more messages and platforms to keep track of than they feel totally at ease handling. It's so easy to get overwhelmed, or to miss responding to an important message or an old friend.




Here are some tips that have helped me to keep up correspondences with friends around the world:
   * following them on social media, keeping an eye on what they're up to, engaging with what they post if I want to
   * sending a message when I think of them
   * sharing tweets or videos or music etc. that I think they’d enjoy
   * phone and/or video calls when we both want to (different rhythms for different friendships)
   * corresponding about specific topics that I enjoy talking about with them
   * collaborating on projects if desired
   * seeing them in person when possible
   * trusting that established shared context exists even when we aren’t in touch for an extended period of time, and the friendship can be picked up in its own season


Short messages are ok! Like “yes!” or “nope” or “thinking of U!” Or my friend Nvpkp’s “smooch”: 
smooch doctrine: sending the word "smooch" to a friend when they come to mind, in order to bypass the hesitation that comes from not having anything to say, really. in the worldview of believing in brotherly love and affection.


It's also ok to send a late reply… even very late! Like years later! U can just... resume an old correspondence with an old internet friend. I promise your friend will be happy to hear from U!


And if U are receiving a late reply from someone—an easy grace goes a long way!


Practically, I really love replying to messages while walking, or in bed after waking up. Find what works for U.


Something about online correspondence that is difficult to intuitively grasp, is that U have the option to be bare-metal synchronous or weeks-late asynchronous in your messages. U have the power to decide. 


Different contexts will call for different speeds and paces. U are dancing with your friends and collaborators, learning what rhythm and pace feels mutually good. U can feel out what feels good and safe and connecting in any given relationship or context. 


U should never apologize for meeting your needs in learning to dance with your friends. U can move fluidly between modes as much as U need to. People who love U and truly care about U will be happy to hear from U whenever it feels good for U.


In a collaborative context, it's helpful to name preferences and mutually agree on, be willing to renegotiate shared expectations (rather than implicitly adopting indirect imposed ones).


Some things can be synchronous, others can be asynchronous—deep connection in any context benefit from both!


May U enjoy connecting with friends around the world! May your correspondences bring U great joy! May they serve your curiosity and the world as a whole!

Mentors
If there’s something I’m curious about, and want to learn more about, I will sometimes seek out a specific mentor, coach, or teacher to support me in learning more about that topic. I’ve worked with mentors and coaches on Tai Chi, music production, writing, meditation, organization design, interpersonal dynamics, and more.


Having the right relationship with the right person can help me to learn what I’m interested in in a more focused, directed, and also fun way. 


I value choosing mentors or coaches who it feels good to be around. It’s easy to feel seen, understood, safe, and happy around these people. They are good listeners and ask good questions. They care about me, and respect what I have to share about my own motivations, goals, questions, and blocks.


Someone could be a world-class expert in something, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they will be a good teacher or guide in helping U to learn about something. 


It’s been critical for me to know myself, to know what I personally need and want—or don’t—and to seek out someone who can support me in that way. 


I think everyone would benefit from having a mentor. Everyone should have a mentor, or two, or three. Have a mentor for every area U really care about, that U want to deepen and learn and grow in.


Imagine that, a few weeks from now, U suddenly meet the perfect mentor for U. They have all the qualities and experiences U've been looking for in someone to listen to U, give U advice and support in the things U care about. 


What makes them such a good fit for U?
________________
Learning Journey: Movement and Embodiment
I really liked soccer when I was a kid. I loved getting to run around and hit the ball with my friends. It was simple, free, and fun.


  



That all changed in the third or fourth grade, when I got a new coach. He was far more intense, pushing us to be competitive. I remember doing drills, kicking a soccer ball around some cones, and finding it really challenging to be coordinated. Kicking the ball too hard, so it would go too far. Feeling humiliated, embarrassed that something seemingly simple was so excruciatingly hard for me—and in such an obvious, visible way to all my peers.


The higher challenge level and the strict, coercive intensity of the coach made it less fun for me. I told my Dad I didn’t want to play soccer any more. He was surprised and disappointed, because I’d really loved soccer before that year. But I had made up my mind: I was quitting.


In high school, U had to either do a sport, or take a gym class. I didn’t feel called to play any of the sports—I didn’t really see the point. I didn’t like any of the sports, and it meant that U had to spend time after school at practice—time that I could be doing my homework, or spending time with friends, or pursuing my hobbies. So I chose to take gym class every year. Other than a bit of volleyball or pickup baseball or basketball for gym class, I mostly didn’t exercise ever as a kid. 


I did do a lot of walking. My bus home in high school was one of the last buses to leave school, and my stop was one of the last stops, so it was actually faster for me to walk home than to take the bus. I preferred that, being able to go for a walk and listen to music or a podcast (which were brand new at the time) on my iPod, rather than being stuck in a bus row on a fake leather bus seat with gross touchfeel, surrounded by kids I didn't particularly like, who didn't particularly like me, either.        


At St. John’s, things changed a bit. St. John’s has a popular intramurals program, with fun things like ultimate frisbee alongside soccer and basketball. Something about the vibe of the intramurals program felt more fun and approachable. People were competitive, but in a light-hearted way—and always encouraging and friendly. U could come and go as U pleased, to whatever sports U especially liked.


So I decided to play. I was allocated to be a “Hustler,” one of the handful of intramural teams (alongside the Druids, Greenwaves, Guardians, and Spartans). I didn’t play every game or season, but I played a handful of games each year.


I also took up a little bit of running, when my friends Campbell and Phil were excited about running together. I was in very poor shape and mostly didn’t keep this up. I also tried CrossFit, but it was so, so, so, hard for me, not only given the shape I was in, but also to be coordinated and do the novel motions they shared each class.


In the summer after my sophomore year, I worked on some organic vegetable farms in Western Massachusetts, through a group called Many Hands Farm Corps. I was inspired by their vision and the other people in the program, but I found the actual work—mostly weeding—boring and arduous, painful.


In retrospect, I was not in very good shape, did not have very good mobility, and was poorly positioned to do five, six, seven hours a day of weeding. We were supposed to squat and use two hands to weed efficiently, and I couldn't maintain a squat for the life of me, let alone use both hands. I think if I'd been in better shape, with better mobility, that would have made the experience easier, more enjoyable, more rewarding.


In summary, I spent most of my childhood and adult life not particularly active, not particularly fit—choosing to spend time on the computer or read books instead of going outside or using my body.


That all changed when I started training at MAPLE. They had a required exercise period each day, where you were required to do some form of movement practice for an hour. When I first got there, what U did was mandated—decided by my teacher, Soryu—but this quickly changed, and for most of the time I was there, U could freely do any movement practice U liked.


This combination of required daily exercise with the freedom to program my own movement practices was really good for me. There was no competition, no arbitrary made-up sport we were all socially pressured to like or enjoy or be good at. There was just moving our bodies for our health and well-being, physically and psychologically.


I saw what each of my fellow monastics were doing: some ran; some did yoga; some did weight training, or bodyweight training; others did more eccentric, idiosyncratic practices. 


I tried a little of this, and a little of that, sampling different things, getting a taste for what I liked and what I didn’t. I did some yoga and learned to swing a kettlebell. I reinvigorated a taste for running. I especially liked Freeletics, a phone app that gives U customized high-intensity, bodyweight strength and conditioning movement routines. The personalization made its challenge level feel feasible, but empowering. I could see how I was improving, workout after workout.


I remember going for a run with my friend Satoru, and him saying that I had an athlete’s body, that I was well suited to running. His encouragement was a pleasant surprise for me. It totally upended my self concept in a way that made new stories and explorations possible.


I started to really like and appreciate the movement period. I saw that I was healthier and happier for moving my body. Yes, I was required to move my body, but unlike how I might have felt in high school if a sport had been required, I didn’t see fit to complain about it. It was a privilege to spend time each day moving my body, caring for my overall fitness, health, and well-being.


Most importantly, I got to develop my own relationship with movement and embodiment, on my own terms. I started to develop a real inner motivation and dedication to movement, a desire to explore, learn, and improve.


I’m not sure I would have made this connection consciously at the time, but this, too, was a manifestation of the third bodhisattva vow, “Gates of truth without measure, vow to know them.” Movement modalities without measure, vow to master them.


At the time, I got really excited about this idea I called “Mind Body Attention”: to consider intellectual, embodiment, and contemplative practices as distinct but mutually supportive. I was fusing my long-term intellectual curiosity with my soul’s desire for contemplative insight, and my new-found interest in embodiment.


The highlight of my movement and embodiment training during my monastic career was with running. I’d done the Couch to 5k program in between stints at the monastery, and decided to ramp up my training even more seriously. I challenged one of my fellow monastics, Chris, to train for a 5k with me. 


  



I did very well competitively in my group, placing in the top three. The following year, I challenged Chris to do a 10k with me. We weren't able to race in an official capacity, due to the pandemic, but we both trained, and we ran our race informally, comparing our times.


That year, I read a running book, Run Less, Run Faster, and adapted it into a running program for myself. Each week, I did a long run, some speed work on a treadmill, hill sprints up the long mountain road at the monastery, and, weather allowing, some swimming for cardiovascular cross-training. I even did a short, slow, easy run each week with mouth tape on to train my capacity for nasal breathing while running.


I trained a little bit too hard, and exacerbated an old injury to my right knee and leg. I remember taking a bath and swearing that I would one day find a way to heal my right leg’s injuries. 


Years later, I discovered Ben Patrick, aka kneesovertoesguy. Through his company ATG (Athletic Truth Group), Patrick has dedicated himself to helping people recover from knee and leg injuries through methods that go against conventional wisdom. His approach focuses on strengthening the muscles and joints around the knee, rather than just treating the symptoms. I knew I had found the answer to my prayers.


As best I can tell, regularly walking backwards, and doing exercises like tibialis raises, calf raises, and the other exercises Patrick recommends has reduced my knee pain, reversed my injuries, and strengthened the muscles in my feet and legs.


Towards the end of my time at the monastery, I became interested in standing meditation or Zhan Zhuang. It generated a tremendous amount of energy in my body and felt supportive to my training—as well as a welcome change of pace from extensive seated practice.


That led to an interest in learning about Qi Gong & Tai Chi. I spent the first year or so after I left MAPLE learning the fundamentals of the Sun Tai Chi form. I found that Sun Tai Chi also generated and circulated energy in my body, while developing my capacity for graceful, integrated, balanced movement. I found that I was carrying my body differently when I practiced regularly. Moreover, I was curious about the martial components of the form, including Sun Style’s heritage in the two other Chinese internal martial arts, Xingyiquan and Baghuazhang. Each of the slow, elegant, seemingly peaceful motions in the form has a vivid, violent form within, like taking someone’s head and shoving it into your kneecap.


  



This year, 2025, when I am writing this essay, I am doing a movement challenge posed by my friend Kristijan, to move every day this year. I’ve been arriving at a trifecta of three movement modalities: bodyweight strength training (Convict Conditioning), running for cardio, and Tai Chi to round it out. When I’m sick or tired, I am turning to doing TRE (Trauma Release Exercises, full body shaking).


Looking back on all this, I feel like I’ve learned a lot about what motivates me personally—about what’s compelling to me about exercise and movement practices, and what’s not. I’m not really interested in sports, except for maybe some pickup ultimate frisbee or soccer or something. Competition isn’t really my thing, nor are games that seem mostly arbitrary and meaningless to me. When I feel into the possibility of playing a sport, it’s easy to imagine feeling weak or inadequate or just not as good as other people. I don’t want to do some sport or movement practice just because everyone else is doing it, or some authority figure told me to.


On the other hand, I’ve found what does motivate me, what does inspire me, what kinds of movement practices I am excited to learn and practice and excel at. I really love running, strength training, and Tai Chi. I love trying new movement modalities, just to get a taste of them, to expand my sense of what’s possible. I love feeling my own body, and deciding each day what feels good for me to do.


I love the sense of constantly progressing, of getting stronger and faster. I love the idea of developing a lean, strong, capable body, with a combination of functional strength, endurance, and mobility. I’m excited to see what becomes possible for me, with years and decades of movement practice through multiple modalities under my belt.


I don't need to be the strongest, bulkiest man in the world. I don't need to run the fastest mile, or the longest ultramarathon. I just want to become the best version of myself, to find my most powerful form. I want to be able to rise to the challenges of my life, ready to flourish in every opportunity I find.
________________
Conclusion
Following my curiosity has been such an important part of my life. Honoring the questions burning in my heart, asking them with my life, has led me on adventures I’ll never forget—and I hope there are many more to come, for me, and also for U.


U must go down many roads in your journeys to learn and grow, U must open many doors, U must come to many seeming dead-ends, U must seem to lose your way time and again.


U must explore solely for the sake of your curiosity, forgetting why it matters, without even beginning to be able to give Urself a plausible account of the merits and possible benefits of what U are exploring, having faith only in your burning curiosity.


U cannot know in advance what U will find, or how it will change your life, or the world—the depths of your curiosity are measured by your unknowing, your faith in the burn.


Explore your interests and curiosities without reason or justification, trust your heart and its wisdom, go down the rabbit holes U need to go down.


Only at the bottom will U discover what U needed to find—U will have new knowledge about the world, new skills to play with, and also U Urself will have been transformed by the process of trusting your curiosity.


following my curiosity with a view towards sharing what I find, to benefit as many people as possible, as deeply as possible

Appendix: Quotes
“Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.” 
— Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet


“There are years that ask questions and years that answer.”
― Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God


“‘The best thing for being sad,’ replied Merlin, beginning to puff and blow, ‘is to learn something. That's the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then — to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you. Look what a lot of things there are to learn.’”
— T.H. White, The Once and Future King


“I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.”
― Mark Twain


“Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.”
― Richard P. Feynman


“Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.”
― Richard Feynmann


“Adults discourage children from asking philosophical questions, first by being patronizing to them and then by directing their inquiring minds towards more “useful” questions. Most adults aren’t themselves interested in philosophical questions. They may be threatened by some of them. Moreover, it doesn’t occur to most adults that there are questions that a child can ask that they can’t provide a definitive answer to and that aren’t answered in a standard dictionary or encyclopedia either.”
— Gareth B. Matthews, Philosophy and the Young Child


“In the end one has to do everything oneself in order to know a few things oneself; that is, one has a lot to do.”
— Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil


“To one who knows how to read, reading a book is coming face to face with a strange man’s nature and manner of thinking, trying to understand him, and if possible to win him as a friend.”
— Hermann Hesse


“[Thinking is] speech that the soul itself goes through with itself about whatever it considers. Of course it’s as one who doesn’t know that I’m declaring it to you. For it has this look to me, that when it’s thinking the soul is doing nothing other than conversing, asking itself questions and and answering them itself, and affirming and denying.”
— Socrates, Plato’s Theaetetus 189E-190A


“I have always imagined that paradise will be a kind of library.”

Appendix: Curiosity Department Vision
The Curiosity Department is one of branch of The Service Guild.


We are learners, and we see our lives and this very universe as a school. For us, our curiosity is sacred, and learning is an act of worship. Learning is endless—there are always more questions, there is always more to be curious about, there is always more to learn.


We aspire to be happy learners, learning and growing and flourishing in our lives, shining brightly in our own singular magnificence. We reflect on what our nature is, what we are curious to learn about, and how we wish to do so, and embark on learning as a journey into a more complex, interesting, fulfilling life for ourselves and the world.


Our learning process begins with noticing, trusting, and following our questions, our curiosities, and our interests. We do not know where they will lead us, but we trust that they will guide us forward through the complexity of our lives and the mysteries of the world.


Divergence: We create learning plans to explore our curiosity: reading books; having conversations; taking online courses; working with teachers, mentors, and coaches; and creating, unique individualized learning experiments or field trips. As we learn, we digest our learning through note-taking, conversation, journaling, and reflection.


Convergence: As we learn, we synthesize what we learn, so that it can be shared with others. We leave the breadcrumbs we wish we’d found when we became interested in a given topic. Ideally, it is easier for others to learn about a topic because we have learned about it. To the extent that our learning leads to novel ideas and new connections between existing ideas, we share those developments with the world. What we learn, the whole world learns.


Throughout this process, we support each other as learning partners—fellow stewards of the flame of curiosity, shepherds of the insights born of following our respective curiosities. We keep track of what we’re learning about individually and collectively, providing accountability and support along the way, and sharing what we find in deep, rich conversation.


Over time, we are able to fold more learners into our process. This gradually takes the shape of a school, a voluntary academy of curious humans consensually electing to continue their learning process, steering by their questions, curiosities, and joy. At this scale, we are able to support more and more learners, with bigger questions and larger learning projects. This will accelerate our collective rate, breadth, and depth of learning, for the benefit of all.

Appendix: altar to the school of the universe


  



i will speak poetically, metaphorically, suggestively, psychoactively


imagine that the universe is a school, and u r here to learn lessons


u r doing great. God (the top teacher) is proud of u and loves u. u will not pass or fail


u get to decide what u r learning and how fast u learn. the most important thing is to learn and grow, and 2 have fun doing so


if u get to decide how fast u learn, then that’s great! feel into how fast u want to learn


the universe would like u 2 know that your learning matters, it really matters


there’s no rush, but it would be good to set the speed of learning as follows:


as fast as U can learn, while it’s still enjoyable 4 u, healthy and safe 4 u, safe and good for others


if we take a moment to view life through the lens or metaphor of a video game: one useful perspective on the game’s difficulty level is the degree of complexity U can skillfully handle while still enjoying and loving Urself, benefitting others rather than harming them


this is what’s needed now in your life and by the people u love and by the universe itself


the universe will slow down and take care of u if u need it 2


but if it’s safe to do so, try to learn as much as U can. no speed limits


one thing u can do is ask urself every day, when u remember, or want to: “what did i learn today?”


visualize it, articulate it to urself, journal about it, tweet about it, share it with a friend. help urself internalize what you’re learning, consolidate it, integrate it


u can learn from everyone u meet, from every moment, from every interaction, from every opportunity, every project, every situation


if U truly believe in your heart of hearts that U can learn from every single person U meet, that U can grow through every single interaction U have, your whole life will be an endless psychoactive journey, a school prepared just for U by the universe itself


share what u learn, u will learn more from doing so, have more fun, benefit more beings more deeply. maximum deep benefit


have the humility to learn from anyone U feel drawn towards


have the confidence to teach anyone who asks


if u r a teacher, give back 2 those who need your help


leave the breadcrumbs U wish you’d found


ask for help from those who can, all will benefit


“Help the person behind U up one step, hope the one above U does the same. Little by little, we climb the pyramid to god, building it as we go. Don’t pull the ladder up behind you.”


don’t rush, don’t hesitate (Soryu’s deepest teaching, bless the Buddha before him)


tell the universe u r here to learn and grow, serve and play


PSA to the universe: i am open to changing radically this year, today, right now if it leads to dramatic improvements in my life and the lives of those i love (all beings) ❤️


slow is smooth, smooth is fast


fast is good, fast is weird


shit’s just gonna keep getting weirder and bigger and harder and better and more beautiful up in this lifeheart, that’s the direction i’m steering in


remember we are in multiplayer mode and every player is good, your friend, love them even if u don’t like them, play fair and fun, play games together that feel good


this will only make sense if U see that i’m playing multiple mutually-supportive safe-to-run fun-to-play games in parallel, in multiplayer mode with players whose games and play styles interface well with the meta.


resonance is the compass we steer by


let your heart be a compass—trust resonance, steer towards love


above all, love urself, be kind to others. learn lots, get good, grow hard, love big, live big


you have full permission to be your wisest self, to live your fullest life, to shine as bright as the sun, and even brighter in the magnificent history of this precious universe


enjoy the ride! u r doing great, u r loved! god is good! may all beings be happy!

Appendix: The Value of Recording and Sharing Conversations
A couple of years ago, I was in a major transition point in my life. I was preparing to leave monastic training, and was uncertain what would come next.


Part of my plan was simply to have lots of conversations with different people, and to see what came of it. I was curious about what was happening in the world, what people in my network were up to, what I might learn from them, and what projects or collaborations or opportunities might come from those conversations.
  

I realized that if I was going to go to the effort of having a lot of conversations with interesting people, that I might as well record those conversations and share them with others—in other words, to start a podcast. I couldn’t know for sure, but it seemed likely that a conversation that I found interesting or beneficial might be for someone else, too.


Recording and sharing my conversations has led me to believe that many, many more conversations should be recorded, and that many more conversations should be shared publicly when recorded: informal conversations between friends, meetings, coaching or therapy sessions, formal conversations with subject matter experts…. a variety of conversations are invaluable to record and share.


Recording is cheap, editing is annoying but easy, and the potential benefits of recording and sharing your conversations are high, albeit hard to predict in advance.


It can be unexpectedly valuable to record conversations with friends, colleagues, coaches and mentors. U won’t necessarily want to record every conversation U have, and U definitely won’t want to share every conversation U record, but being able to revisit and potentially share your conversations can be unexpectedly valuable.


I’ve been privileged to have many conversations that have changed my life. The idea that I could have more of those conversations, and share them with people, was very exciting.
I was partly inspired by Visa, who posts a lot of videos on his YouTube channel of him talking without editing—just talking at length about things he’s interested in or thinking about. I record these kinds of videos as well now, but I realized that something similar could be done with “podcasts”—that I didn’t need intro music or outro music or even to edit ums and ahs or silences out—I could just keep the conversations exactly as they were, without editing, and it would be less work for me and also more authentic (at least to my ears).


I was also inspired by my friends Malcolm Ocean, Sarah McManus, and Eric Chisholm. They had introduced me to the value of recording conversations when I met them—a practice they had adopted from the Liminal Space Agency in Waterloo—pointing out that U might want to review the conversations later or share them with others (with permission, of course). I spoke with Malcolm about this on my podcast.
Why Record and Share your Conversations
Recording and sharing the conversations that U have provides a number of benefits.


For starters, U can revisit the conversations U have. It can be easy to forget exactly what happened in a conversation, especially if it was long, or if the participants were emotionally activated. Having them recorded and transcribed allows U to look back at them later.


You can remember specific points that were made, revisit tasks that were agreed upon, or notice the conversational dynamics that were present from a third person perspective.


Having a recording available is especially useful if the participants have differing memories or accounts of what exactly transpired. A recording makes it possible to objectively determine what was said or what exactly transpired in a conversation.
  

I’ve also found it practically useful to revisit conversations to hear the points made, or the precise words or phrases that were used. This can be useful for turning a conversation into a tweet or a longer form of writing. For example, I used a section of my conversation with my friend Jane Miller as the basis of part of my blog post on Boundaries.


You don’t have to, but recording a conversation makes it possible to share the conversation with others. It can be useful to share a conversation with not only the people who participated, but also other collaborators or friends U are connected to—or even more widely by sharing it in public.


Of course, U have to consider the privacy of the conversation, and make sure that the people who participated are ok with it being shared, but U never know who might find listening to your conversation valuable.


When U share your recorded conversations, it opens U up to new and deeper connections with your network the world at large. Having a podcast or a YouTube channel makes U more visible, opening U up to new, serendipitous opportunities.
How to Share Your Conversations
If U want to share your recordings publicly, U can do so very easily by recording a Zoom call, and then uploading the audio to Anchor, and/or uploading the video to YouTube. Zoom recordings work well because they’re so convenient, but U can use any audio or video file.


For videos, YouTube is great because U can keep them private, make them public, share them as unlisted videos—videos that are only accessible to people who have the URL.
It can also be valuable to share part of a video, either instead of or in addition to a whole conversation. I share exceptionally valuable excerpts from my video podcast in a dedicated playlist on YouTube.


I like to license my conversations with Creative Commons, which I use as often as possible for my projects. I want to benefit as many people as possible, and Creative Commons is a wonderful vehicle for enabling that. Depending on the license U pick, conversations can be redistributed, edited, remixed, or even sold.
Possible Concerns
Recording a conversation is easy, but editing and sharing it might seem confusing. For myself, I do as little editing as possible. Most of the time, I drag and drop the Zoom recording as is, without adding an introduction or removing silence or what have you.


I don’t want to waste time editing if I don’t have to. I want to record stuff and hit post the same day. My production quality is lower than other podcasts, but I can focus my time and energy on things I actually care about with the podcast—quality guests, quality questions, quality conversations—as well as totally different projects.


You might find it valuable to record your conversations, but be hesitant to share it with others, out of concern for your privacy. Of course, privacy is an important variable—not only for you, but for the people you’re speaking with. Use your discernment about what U want to share, and obviously, be sure that U have the consent of the people you’re speaking with to share the conversation.


You might also be hesitant to share it with others, for fear of wasting the people’s time. There’s so much good content out there already! If so, it’s considerate of U to want to not waste other people’s time, but no one has to listen to your conversation or read your blog post or browse your email newsletter.


Maybe that means that nobody will listen to your conversation if U record it. That’s very possible! But if people do end up listening to it, it probably means that it really resonated for them—that they were interested in learning more about you, or the person U were talking about, and the things U conversed about together. If U follow your own preferences for what U like when U create things, it’s more likely that the people who would resonate with your interests and your aesthetic preferences will find what U make and like it, too.


For myself, I wanted to do a video podcast, because I value being able to see a guest’s facial expressions and body language in a conversation. One hesitation that I had was that I wanted people to be able to watch the recordings at advanced speeds. I really love listening to podcasts or audiobooks at advanced speeds on my phone, and while U can do that with YouTube, the default interface only allows U to go up to 2x, whereas I can listen to podcasts or audiobooks at 3 or even 3.25x.


When I learned about the Video Speed Controller extension, which gives U the ability to watch YouTube videos at arbitrary speeds, it dissolved this particular obstacle for me, and I felt better about recording and sharing long conversations in a video format.


  

Conclusion
If you’re having a valuable conversation, U might as well record it. U can decide whether U want to revisit it or share it later, but developing a habit of recording and possibly sharing conversations may be unexpectedly beneficial in the future.


The only metric of whether a conversation was good or not is whether you, the participants, enjoyed it or not. That’s all that matters.


That is a good thing in itself, to have a good conversation with someone else—a conversation that its participants enjoy is one that someone who chooses to listen to a recording of is likely to enjoy, too.


Thank U to Soryu Forall, Malcolm Ocean, Sarah McManus, Eric Chisholm, and Visa for showing me the value of recording and sharing conversations. Thank U to Loopy for suggesting I write this post. Thank U to Eric Chisholm and Malcolm Ocean for reviewing this post and providing feedback.

Appendix: The Art of Writing the Informational Blog Post
There’s a genre of blog posts that many of my blog posts fall into: what I call the “informational blog post.”


Not all of my writing falls into this category. I also write shitposts, autobiographical stories and bedtime stories. But the informational blog post is the bread and butter of my blog.


The topic? Anything I’m interested in. Fundraising. The Strategic Theory of John Boyd. The spiritual teachings of Rob Burbea. It varies pretty widely.
  

Whatever the topic, I try to write about what I’m curious about in a way that shares what I’ve found in a way that will be of benefit to others.


The gold standard for my informational blog posts is “write the piece I wish I’d had/read when I started being interested in the topic.”


Or, more poetically—to “leave the breadcrumbs I wish I’d found.”


This is why it makes me so, so happy to hear when people find my writing useful…. because they had the gift of reading the thing I wished I’d had when I started.
Making posts like this helps everyone.


It helps me to synthesize what I’ve learned, so that I remember it better and internalize it more deeply. And it helps the reader to discover something new—a new topic to learn about, a new skill to explore—a whole new world.


The informational blog post is not merely informational. A strong contender in the genre will also inspire the reader to be interested in the material, provide context about the topic, give actionable next steps, etc. It should feel like it has a strong personal voice, with the character and context and personality of the author shining through each word and paragraph.


Over time, I’ve found a basic formula for structuring these posts:
   * Start with a story: stories inspire people, making it personal and relevant.
   * Relevant context: frame the relevant context in an approachable and interesting way—like a Wikipedia or encyclopedia article, but more personable and friendly, opinionated.
   * Give specifics: include specific things to try, starting routines, exercises, etc.
   * Curate further resources: make a list of recommended reading or other resources, pointing the reader to places they can turn to for more information should they wish to continue their journey exploring the topic.
   * End with love: it turns out a little loving kindness is a good way to conclude a blog post. Here’s how I concluded my Fundraising post:
  



I want my writing to benefit as many people as possible, as deeply as possible. Making my blog posts freely accessible and Creative Commons-licensed helps me to do that practically.

Appendix: Poast Drafts
  

Inspired by my friend Loopy, I’ve been posting my “drafts” on Twitter on Sundays for several weeks.
Drafts are any tweets that U may not have posted yet, potentially but not necessarily saved in the drafts function of Twitter[3], which are typically of more varied quality, form, or content than your usual posts. (You could also use this same approach on a different platform.)
My drafts tend to be rougher, more off the cuff, exploratory, and also unhinged than what I might ordinarily post. 
I hope this post will give U a sense of what draft posting is all about, and perhaps encourage U to join in on the fun and post some drafts of your own.
Why Post Drafts
Loopy recommends posting drafts if U care too much about follower count. Ideally, social media is less about a number, or a popularity contest, and more about exploration and expression. Drafting helps U refocus your attention on the creative process.


For me, the biggest benefit of posting drafts is that it stretches me creatively. I like to think of the drafts as a way to give myself a creative space to try out new ideas. It’s a form of play. For me, drafts are a great way to dissolve creative blocks, and explore new ideas, topics, or modes of expression that I might not otherwise try. 


I’m also finding that writing a higher volume of tweets is pushing me into new territory. It turns out that if U shoot for a large quantity of tweets, and open up to the possibility of posting “bad” quality posts, U also open Urself up to discovering more good quality material. This is true more generally, with all acts of expression—making visual art, or dance, or music.


Every Sunday, I post tens or hundreds of drafts, and then I'm like, “Damn, how do I do it all over again?”—but then over the course of the next week, it just happens. 
Posting drafts also let me feel a little bit more comfortable sharing something that might be vulnerable. Because you’re posting a large number of tweets at the same time, people tend to read fewer of these posts. Effectively, that means that U can hide tweets in plain sight.
I like to post polished material that I feel proud of or excited about during the week—things that I want to actively encourage people to see and engage with—and explore newer, more creative, playful, and vulnerable posts in my drafts.
How To Write and Post Drafts
This practice is very simple. Make a note on your computer and/or in your phone called Tweet Drafts. 


Twitter has functionality for storing drafts, but it’s not very good—your drafts don’t sync between devices, and they also get deleted if U deactivate your account. Notes apps are better for this purpose. 


Begin drafting. If U have a thought during the week, write it down in your note. It doesn’t have to be perfect or polished—even just a word or a sentence fragment will do. U can always change it or edit it later.


Some possible things that U can do:
   * crosspost: copy/paste texts or other messages you’ve sent that might be fun or valuable to share more broadly
   * use it as a journal with keywords to capture salient memories or inside jokes for Urself
   * capture memorable quotes from conversations
   * ask questions
   * bang out a bunch of variations on a meme, like bf gf, or guy who


Try to be ok with lower quality than usual. It’s ok to post something that U think is “bad” quality—and U might be surprised by what ends up resonating for other people!


When you’ve reached a significant number of drafts—or when it’s Sunday—simply copy and paste your drafts, one at a time, into Twitter and hit post. It’s fun to post on Sundays because other people are doing it—Loopy, myself, Tanya, and occasionally a few others—but U can post drafts in bulk at any time.


Optionally, if you’d like, U can make some kind of warning before U post your drafts, so that your followers know what’s happening. People may not expect to see a high volume of posts at a time from you, and it can help to set expectations.


Here’s a tweet Loopy sometimes uses:


WARNING: I'm going to poast drafts soon, something I Simply Must Do now and again. Some of them aren't respectful of the microslice of your time and attention you've entrusted to me. Please stand by. 


or U could post an image like this one from Loopy:


  

Conclusion
I’ve felt excited to read Loopy’s drafts every Sunday for months now, and, since I’ve started posting drafts on Sundays, too, I feel excited to share my own every week, too.


If U use Twitter, enjoy reading drafts, or want to experiment with expressing Urself in new ways, consider writing and posting drafts. 
Wouldn't it be funny if the timeline was flooded with a thousand deranged drafts every Sunday? 
Wouldn't it be lovely if the timeline was flooded with a thousand wisdom drafts every Sunday, or a thousand jokes, or a thousand interesting reflections? 
It will take courage to post your drafts—but there’s creative spiritual interpersonal gold in there, in the pile of drafts and in the process of writing and sharing them. 
I plan to keep going for the time being, including this Sunday!

Appendix: The Solar System Model of Collective Learning
co-authored with Kristijan


This model uses the concept of a solar system to relate multiple individual learners (planets) exploring their shared intention or curiosity (the sun). In this metaphor, the solar system is the larger system as a whole. A comet is a teacher with more expertise and experience who is able to give instruction, exercises, feedback.


As a learner decides to learn more about something, we propose that this basic “curiosity loop” will serve them in approaching their learning:


   1. Find resources, teachers, and learning contexts for a topic that’s interesting to U.
   2. Dive deeper to learn more about it. Ingest the materials, take notes and process what U learn, internalize the lessons.
   3. Come back and share what U have learned with others. Leave the breadcrumbs U wish U’d found. In this way, your learning is a service to others.


  



This corresponds to one circle around the axis, a rotation of the planet (U, the learner). It’s intended to be bite sized, manageable and fun. 


The planet revolves around its axis potentially many times while circling its star. So there are many iterations of find-learn-share. Examples of small rotations:
   * learning new functions in a programming language and tweeting about them
   * drawing many small sketches
   * producing a snippet of music or even a track
   * shooting individual scenes of film


The different learners’ projects are thematically connected around the same curiosity or intention, the sun—they’re in the same solar system. They can ask for and offer support, and share their process with the other learners for mutual benefit.
  

After each learner goes through a few rotations, disparate pieces of knowledge start to connect into a larger picture. As the learners interact with their potent sources of knowledge, they get a sense of the bigger picture and ask broader and deeper questions. The possibility of a larger project starts to emerge.


While still iterating the basic find-learn-share loop, bits of knowledge can trickle into this larger project. Examples of a full revolution:
   * from individual tweets or threads to a larger, longer essay
   * from individual film clips to a short movie
   * from a voice memo of someone singing to a full song
   * from rough hand-drawn sketches to a full painting


Completing a larger learning project corresponds to one full revolution of the planet around the star.


The project may involve a teacher or guide, which is represented by a comet visiting all orbits of the solar system. The teacher is there to visit infrequently, offer a light touch, some feedback, or course correction.


Because our lives are busy and energy fluctuates, it’s sometimes hard to maintain consistent effort on learning something new. Creating a temporary container is valuable for mustering our own internal forces and focusing intently for a period of time. It also creates a sense of camaraderie and adds motivation from other people when our fuel runs low.


We want to create such a temporary container for a group of learners to go through a 4-6 week learning journey together. They can commit together at the start, complete many rotations and a single big revolution, bringing all their projects to a close at the same time.
  







We represent this as a harmonic convergence of all planets, which offers an opportunity to celebrate success and reflect on the journey they just completed.
Conclusion
This model will inform our approach for the next year. We are going to create several crews or containers for learners to learn around specific themes and learning areas, with the support and context of the Curiosity Department. We hope that this will help people to learn more deeply, and share what they learn more effectively to benefit others and ultimately the whole world.


May the questions that burn in our hearts light the way. ❤️

Appendix: thoughts on do 100 thing
   1. Visa “invented” / coined the phrase “do 100 thing.” if there’s something U are interested in doing, if there’s a new skill or area U want to explore, try doing it 100x!
   2. here’s a bunch of running thoughts on the “do 100 thing” challenge idea, on what I’ve learned so far, what works for me & might for U as well!!!
   3. it can literally be any damn thing! do 100 pushups! cook 100 omelettes! draw 100 owls!


  

“100 €” by driver Photographer, CC BY-SA 2.0


   4. it can be a small thing, like 100 deep breaths, or a big thing, like 100 feature films! U get to decide the scope of the “thing” U will do 100x
   5. U can pick something just because, because U damn well feel like it, or it can be in connection to a larger goal U have, a vision U are trying to bring about for ur life
   6. here are some “do 100 things” challenges i’ve completed: 100 blog posts, 100 podcasts, 100 drawings, 100 vlogs
   7. here are some “do 100 things” challenges i’m still doing: 100 email newsletters, 100 vibe word games, 100 flash fictions
   8. U decide what counts as 1/100. U know when U are done with doing the thing once, when U have completed the challenge, when U’ve done it 100x. it can be illegible or implicit or hard-to-explain
   9. this isn’t school. it’s not a test. there’s no teacher or authority U have to please, other than urself. do it once, a hundred times for ur own joy and benefit, in service of living ur highest life
   10. it doesn’t have to be something other people understand. it doesn’t have to be legible to them. U don’t have to be able to explain or articulate it to someone else. just do the thing 100x!
   11. the whole point of doing something 100 times is to explore it, and to have fun doing so. if it stops being fun, U can make a change! U can quit! U can do something else instead!
   12. it’s ok to stop doing something partway through! U don’t have to do it 100x just because U started it
   13. U also don’t have to do it the same way every time! feel free to do it differently, to try new things, to experiment, to make adjustments!
   14. try to learn something new every time U do it! little iterations of learning and growth compound over time, result in excellence
   15. have a bias towards action! it says DO 100 things on the tin! maybe consider reading things that aren’t doing the thing (which is also not doing the thing!)
   16. it’s also ok to not do the thing! do things other than the thing! do what U really want to!
   17. follow what’s genuinely alive for U, in a felt embodied way, rather than ur cached concept of what U are supposed to do
   18. if it feels comfortable, safe, ok—ship the thing publicly! share it with others! let others see what U make, revel in ur progress, participate in what U are making, cheer U on, get inspired!
   19. share imperfect things sooner, rather than perfect things later—or worse, perfect things never! it’s better to share imperfect things sooner, so that they can benefit others and U can get feedback on what people resonate with, what they like and don’t like, what comes up for them as an idea or a possibility when they see what U’ve been cooking—than it is to share a perfect thing later
   20. it’s helpful to take notes as U go about what U are learning, how U are growing. make it private or public, a thread or a piece of paper or a doc or a blog post or a vlog. whatever it is, take notes as U go
   21. if U are on Twitter, consider creating a thread to document ur 100 things, or a meta-thread to document ur progress and growth and insights along the way
   22. documenting and sharing on Twitter helps U mark ur progress across time, so that U can learn as U go
   23. but it also helps U receive social accountability, feedback from others, encouragement along the way, questions and curiosities! all of those are fuel for the journey!
   24. Visa says that after having done something 10-20x, it’s a useful checkpoint to review what U’ve done so far, see if there are any shifts or changes that U want to make in any way
   25. consider information architecture as a gift to ur future self. help ur future self to find ur current work. make it easy on them. don’t give them a headache. send them love through acts of present kindness and consideration
   26. index ur shit! if U are doing it 100x, make an index for it!
   27. if U are keeping a thread on Twitter, number ur tweets and threads. prefix the tweet with numbers, the index
   28. if U have a notebook, are writing something on paper, make sure number ur pages
   29. circle / highlight / star important pages in the notebook! “identify all the pages that you find interesting enough to want to revisit in the future”
   30. make a paper index of those important physical pages
   31. Visa has a whole work-in-progress book on indexing, INDEX!
   32. here’s my thread of excerpts from the WIP book
   33. depending on the thing, it could be useful to keep a spreadsheet to track the thing, and ur progress along the way
   34. a little bit of spreadsheet-fu goes a long way. it’s one thing to enter a number or a simple formula—much more is possible for using spreadsheets!
   35. here’s a lovely thread from Rich Bartlett with useful, inspiring spreadsheet knowledge, tips and tricks
   36. personally, i also this $100 course from Ben Collins on Google Sheets Essentials very helpful for mastering intermediate stages of spreadsheet use, getting comfortable with using them at a higher level
   37. U want to make it as simple and easy as possible to track ur progress, to know how many out of 100 U’ve done so far
   38. U want to make it as simple and easy as possible to find individual instances of the thing, to revisit ur work
   39. having a hyperlink for any specific instance of the thing where possible (Painting #3, Stand-Up Comedy Video #47) is extremely useful for making it easier to reference
   40. learn to stoke ur motivation, to inspire urself, to stay close to that inspiration, to rekindle it when needed.
   41. learn ur own rhythms, of how fast U can do something, of the rate or pace at which U can successively do 100 things, of when and why U need a break or respite from a particular challenge
   42. when U do something 100x, U are also learning about urself. U are gaining meta-awareness of how U like to learn how U grow, how U like to play
   43. a learner who knows how they like to learn, how they need to learn, who is familiar and well-practiced in learning new things and developing excellence, is dangerous, is not to be trifled with, will transform in themselves again and again and one day shake the world
   44. doing something 100x is an investment in urself, knowing it’s possible to learn and grow and get better at the thing.
   45. doing something 100x is opening a door to eventual mastery. U may not master the thing, but it is possible, it becomes possible when U embark on doing 100 thing
   46. “learn one, do one, teach one!” as U learn and grow in something U care about, U are well-positioned to help others along the way. “leave the breadcrumbs U wish U’d found”
   47. when U see the value of doing something 100x, U will naturally want to do multiple things 100x. U will start seeing “do 100 thing” as a hammer swing, a lever to pull in many contexts
   48. it’s also possible to “do 100 thing”…100x! Visa, myself, and some others are embarking on that long-term goal.
   49. doing 100 things 100x—100×100—done thoughtfully, carefully, skillfully, iteratively is a recipe for eventual genius
   50. i made big progress recently with do 100 thing 100 times by updating my meta tracker spreadsheet to automatically update when the individual challege spreadsheets change. manually updating them was making it a drag to do
   51. here’s what it looks like:
  



   52. that worked with two different Google Sheets functions:
   53. COUNTA(): lets U count the number of non-empty cells in a range. this is useful for tracking progress—like how many times U’ve done a particular thing out of 100
   54. IMPORTRANGE(): lets U pull data from another spreadsheet—which is helpful for tracking progress on multiple “do 100 thing” challenges, across multiple docs.
   55. i also use checkboxes to mark projects that are completed.
   56. i also use color coding to visually track my progress in these do 100 thing challenges. i use conditional formatting to show completed projects as a full green, whereas new projects are red—with lighter or darker shades of those colors for partially cmopleted projects.
   57. the color scale makes it easy to see at a glance which projects are just beginning, which are halfway there, and which are nearly or fully complete.
   58. if U actually want to get good, simple practice isn’t enough. U also need theory, feedback, to correct errors. see this incredible and inspiring thread from Lulie for a complimentary perspective, that says mere repetition is not sufficient
   59. do 100 thing is a nice blend of means/ends, conditions/consequences, intent and non-coercion. U are setting up the conditions for good consequences, in a procedural sorta means/ends way (just do it 100x), with a specific intent, but in a lightly-held, non-coercive way
   60. U develop ur meta-skills at learning, creating, etc.
   61. consider “talk to leads of people” / “talk to 100 people” as a possible do 100 thing challenge!
   62. consider “do 100 small collaborations” as a possible do 100 thing challenge!
   63. if having conversations is part of ur challenge, consider recording and potentially sharing ur conversations so others can listen in, for maximum deep benefit!
   64. do 100 things is just the start, for dipping ur feet in.
   65. do things once, do it twice, do it 100x! and if U do it 100x, and it’s still fun—maybe go for 200x! that’s 2 do 100 thing challenges! or, why not do it 550 times! 1,000 times? 10,000 times?
   66. “tbh 100 times is for the casuals”
   67. something happens when U cross different thresholds!
   68. something changes when U’ve done it once, when U go from Zero to One, from never having done it to having done it once
   69. something changes when U’ve done it a few times, not just a one-off fluke but a recurring instance, multiple notches under ur belt
   70. something changes when U’ve done it ten or twenty times, when U have a number of instances that U’ve done it and have a burdgenoing portfolio of experiences or artifacts to look back on
   71. something changes when U’ve done it one hundred times, when U are no longer a total beginner but are newly familiar with the territory, when U’ve put a meaningful first twenty hours into developing competence and expertise
   72. something changes when U’ve published a million words. watch ur writing speed accelerate dramatically, for example—U can now draft a nearly-perfect draft on the first go, in half an hour, an hour or two
   73. U can do 100 thing collectively! if U are in a group, crew, company U can embark on a collective “do 100 thing” challenge. write 100 blog posts together! host 100 Zoom calls! host 100 parties! whatever ur thing is, consider doing it 100x, together!
   74. enjoy the journey! the point isn’t to do 100 things, or to get to the moment in time where U’ve done it 100x, 100x. the point is to have fun along the way, learn and grow, celebrate the wins!
   75. 100 is an arbitrary number! it can be a useful and inspiring number but it’s not about metrics
   76. the point is to DO stuff and to LIVE UR BEST LIFE, not to check a checkbox for the sake of checking a checkbox,
   77. the point is to genuinely LIVE ur best and highest life, not to live the appearance of it, not the semblance of an excellent life according to some concept of it but instead the actual genuine instance of it
   78. no i haven’t quite made it to 100 thoughts here yet! this is a work in progress! i’m sharing this before it’s done so it will benefit U sooner!
   79. i bet U anything by the time I’ve done 100 things 100x i’ll have ~20 more thoughts than I did today in late July of 2025!
   80. may i live to do 100 things, 100 times! may i live a long and healthy life, with abundant joy for me and tremendous benefit for the world! may we live our highest, fullest lives, for our own fulfillment and in service to all living beings!

[1] “number of books read per year” is a weird, albeit useful metric. not all books are created equal. heck, not all pages are created equal. reading a thousand page russian novel for the first time is the same as reading a three hundred page math textbook is the same as re-reading a novel U loved in your childhood. still, i’ve found it useful as an approximation of my reading rate and a way to notice patterns over time.
[2] This thread shares more about that experience, what I specifically worked on with Sasha, and what I learned from him (and have since continued to practice).
